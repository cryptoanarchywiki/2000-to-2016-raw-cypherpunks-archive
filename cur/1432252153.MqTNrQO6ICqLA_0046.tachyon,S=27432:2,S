               The performance of the Canadian Venture Exchange
               (CDNX) can best be measured by comparing it with
               the U.S. Nasdaq Composite 100. The CDNX began
               with its indices value set at 2000 on November
               11, 1999. The main index closed trading on June
               1, 2001 at 3,251. That's a 62% increase. In
               comparison, during the same time period the
               Nasdaq Composite suffered a 38% decline, from
               3,421 on November 11, 1999 to close at 2,149 on
               June 1, 2001.

             Discovery To Produce 5.5 Million Cubic Feet of
                          Natural Gas Per Day
             Touchstone Announces Ligonbach Simpson Interval

          HOUSTON, June 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Touchstone Resources
          USA, Inc. (CDNX: TUT.V ) announces that the Ligon
          State 22 #2 sidetrack has completed a open hole drill
          stem test of the middle Simpson formation over an
          interval from 14,920 feet to 15,250 feet. Fractured
          limestone was tested at a rate of 5.5 MMCFPD during a
          1 hour flow period. The well is being drilled to a
          proposed depth of 18,500 feet to test the Ellenburger
          formation. The original well reached a depth of
          16,640 feet, but failed to reach its objective
          because of thrust faulting.

          An Atoka zone above 12,000 feet had strong mud-log
          shows and may be behind pipe pay.

          The operator encountered a number of Delaware sands
          in the original hole from approximately 5,000-7,000
          feet. Several of these intervals were cored and are
          considered potential pay sands. Subsequently, the
          Ligon State 22 #3, located to the east of the #2, was
          drilled to a depth of 6,830 feet and completion
          efforts have commended on the lowermost interval.

          The Ligonbach Prospect, in the Waha/Lockridge
          Project, is located in Reeves County, Texas.

          [Image]FEATURED REPORT                        [Image]

          The Research Works, Inc, the publishing division of
          stocksontheweb.com, publishes reports on companies
          they feel have strong sales and earnings prospects,
          proprietary assets, and capitalizations that are low
          relative to their earnings potential. They recently
          ran a report on Touchstone Resources:

          Use of Advanced Seismic Technologies to Maximize the
           Success Rate for Discovery of High-Impact  Oil and
                              Gas Prospects

          Touchstone Resources Ltd. (the "Company") is engaged
          in the exploration and development of oil and gas
          prospects in East and West Texas and southern
          Louisiana. Its strategy is to grow its oil and gas
          production and reserves rapidly by (1) partnering
          with larger independent oil companies in particularly
          promising projects and (2) developing its own
          properties based on its proprietary 3-D seismic data
          sets and its well regarded in-house expertise in
          analyzing 3-Dseismic data.

          Among the Company's key proprietary assets are an
          extensive library of 3-D seismic data and in-house
          technical capability to work the data. The library
          consists of nearly 1,000 square miles of data in East
          Texas and approximately 250 square miles in West
          Texas. The technical people working the data have
          developed proprietary algorithms to assist them in
          data interpretation.

          The Company has a half dozen major oil and gas
          projects underway. There are six rigs drilling,
          including three for deep drilling; six wells testing
          and completing; and seven wells producing. Management
          has a knowledge base relating to deep gas reserves
          that is unusual for a company of this size. Early
          results from drilling activity are very encouraging,
          and there could be six to seven new production wells
          per month through year-end. The Company is hopeful
          that its projects will have some very sizable
          discoveries in the near term.

          Significant oil and gas production is expected to
          begin early this summer and build rapidly over the
          following several years. Management recognizes the
          value of maintaining low corporate overhead, and it
          outsources many functions in an attempt to minimize
          overhead expenditures. Estimates for 2002 show
          potential production of 9.16 BCFE and potential cash
          flows of $34.4 million.

          Estimates of the reserves and economics of the major
          projects show that the present value of the cash
          flows (discounted at 10%) is $366 million. This
          compares with an equity market capitalization for the
          Company of only $41 million.

<p><font face="Garamond">Significant oil and gas production is expected
to begin early this summer and build rapidly over the following several
years. Management recognizes the value of maintaining low corporate overhead,
and it outsources many functions in an attempt to minimize overhead expenditures.
Estimates for 2002 show potential production of 9.16 BCFE and potential
cash flows of $34.4 million.</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">Estimates of the reserves and economics of the
major projects show that the present value of the cash flows (discounted
at 10%) is $366 million. This compares with an equity market capitalization
for the Company of only $41 million.</font>
