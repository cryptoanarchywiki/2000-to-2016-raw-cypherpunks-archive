Speaking about facts checking: intrigued by these allegations I looked up wiki on Omydiar, and his network association is said to have partnered with the CIA, which is not generally all about "philanthropy", although this claim lack any reference. 

Would someone know why is the Agency mentioned there? 

Aside from that, financed projects include "mobile intelligence" for prospectors and deploying banks onto mobile phones to make sure everyone even in Africa pays his fees to the landlords. They even dare to say it's cheaper than cash. I wonder how that is. 


Anyway... Wild allegations are very entertaining, but seriously what's the real meaning of this about Tor? 
Because no technical evidence suggest it is "backdoored" (whatever that would mean, this is a trendy word, makes the one who says it sound so l33t in journalism circles). 

On the other hand, Tor devs are more and more often prone on reminding that traffic analysis/correlation is not part of their threat model. The problem is that it is nowadays a definitely proven capability of adversaries. 

I really can't help thinking this is a deliberate desire of keeping Tor at government's reach because the eternal argument they oppose do not stand. They say that randomized wait times at each relay would make the traffic too slow. But I remember using Tor 8 years ago when it took forever to load a Web page, and still did I use it in spite of this major extra effort, because anonymous surfing was such a blast. 
Today the network is fast enough to be able to swap 25% speed for a massive increase of anonymity. 
The other solution, randomized length of packets with dummy padding discarded at each relay would impact even less on responsiveness. 

I honestly can't see why they legitimately refuse to implement this. 
They seem to think that the need to observe both ends is too hard. Did they hear about the BGP routing attack that targeted Iceland? Funny how the Silk Road server was found a month later in... Oh shit, Iceland. 

When you claim to protect activists with government money, you'd better not show dubious intentions if people trust are what you depend on. Because that's why Tor was opened at first. The government officials needed to hide among civilian traffic. They do need the people to run nodes.
