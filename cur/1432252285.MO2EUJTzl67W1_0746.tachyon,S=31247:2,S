   TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:
   
   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on April 3, 2001, at 9:30 a.m., in Department
   E of the United States District Court for the Western District of
   Washington, located at 1717 Pacific Avenue, Tacoma, Washington 98402,
   Declan McCullagh ("McCullagh"), a reporter for Wired News, will and
   hereby does move the Court for an order quashing a Subpoena in a
   Criminal Case served by the Office of the United States Attorney. In
   the alternative, McCullagh requests that the Court enter a protective
   order limiting the testimony of McCullagh at the trial of James Dalton
   Bell to matters that were published by Wired News.
   
   McCullagh asks that the subpoena be quashed, or a protective order
   entered, on the separate grounds that inquiry beyond those matters
   that were published is (1) unreasonable and oppressive as defined by
   Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and (2) would
   violate the First Amendment's protection of unpublished information
   gathered by journalists. Each of these grounds is amplified and
   explained in the attached Memorandum of Points and Authorities.
   
   This Motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the attached
   Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the attached Declaration of
   Declan McCullagh, the complete files and records in this action, and
   on such argument and evidence as may be presented to the Court at the
   hearing on this Motion.

       Attorneys for non-party witness DECLAN McCULLAGH
       
                    MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
   
                                     1.
                            SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
   
   By this motion, non-party witness Declan McCullagh ("McCullagh"), a
   reporter for Wired News, an online news magazine published by Lycos,
   Inc., seeks to quash the trial subpoena served on him by the Office of
   the United States Attorney. That subpoena requires him to testify for
   the government at the trial of James Dalton Bell and produce copies of
   two articles written by McCullagh and published by Wired News ("the
   Articles"):
   
     * "Crypto-Convict Won't Recant," published April 14, 2000; and
     * "IRS Raids Cypherpunk's House," published November 11, 2000.
       
   The prosecutor has informed counsel for McCullagh that McCullagh will
   be asked only to verify the accuracy of statements by Bell that are
   included in the Articles. Bell's counsel, however, has made clear that
   cross-examination will not be limited to published information, and
   Bell might seek testimony regarding a variety of areas that Bell
   thinks will be helpful to his defense. In response to a proposal by
   the government and McCullagh's counsel that the parties stipulate to
   the accuracy of the published statements, Bell's counsel has referred
   the question to Bell. Bell has not responded to correspondence from
   McCullagh's counsel regarding a stipulation, and declined on Thursday,
   March 29, 2001, to meet with McCullagh's counsel at the federal
   penitentiary. It is unknown at this time whether Bell will sign the
   stipulation, necessitating this motion.
   
   While the government might intend only to elicit testimony regarding
   published information - which McCullagh has offered to verify by
   affidavit - the subpoena sets the stage for an inquiry into
   McCullagh's newsgathering practices and his unpublished work product.
   Based on the statements of Bell's counsel, it appears likely that Bell
   will attempt to use McCullagh as his mouthpiece by compelling him to
   repeat before the jury Bell's allegations of conspiracy and
   persecution by federal prosecutors and agents, and by compelling
   McCullagh to disclose information that he has gathered over the past
   seven years while covering policy and technology - including the
   "cypherpunk" phenomenon - for publications including Wired News and
   Time magazine.
   
   Such an intrusion into newsgathering is not permitted under Rule 17 of
   the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or the First Amendment to the
   United States Constitution. While the government might consider the
   published statements of Bell to be relevant, a wide-ranging inquiry
   into McCullagh's unpublished research as a journalist is unreasonable
   and oppressive, and runs afoul of the First Amendment's protection of
   newsgathering and the editorial process. This First Amendment-based
   journalists' privilege reflects "the preferred position of the First
   Amendment and the importance of a vigorous press." Zerilli v. Smith,
   656 F.2d 705, 712 (D.C. Cir. 1981).
   
   Requiring McCullagh to testify, even if it is very limited on direct
   examination, creates an impermissible burden by necessarily exposing
   McCullagh to the risk of an intrusive cross-examination that will
   interfere with McCullagh's current and future newsgathering.
   Accordingly, the Court should quash the subpoena or, in the
   alternative, enter a protective order limiting McCullagh's testimony
   to those matters that were published in the Articles.
   
   2.
       BACKGROUND
       
   McCullagh is the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for Wired News. He has
   been an on-line journalist since 1995, and has covered politics and
   technology for numerous publications, both traditional and online.
   Prior to joining Wired News, McCullagh was a reporter for Time
   magazine and Time Digital Daily, and a correspondent for HotWired.
   (Declaration of Declan McCullagh  2.)
   
   McCullagh has been covering Bell's battles with the law since April
   1997, and has written about six articles about Bell, including the two
   articles regarding which the government now seeks McCullagh's
   testimony. (Id.  5.) McCullagh continues to conduct interviews and
   collect information about Bell and the "cypherpunk" movement, with the
   intention of publishing additional articles. (Id.  6.) It has been
   his intention to cover Bell's trial. (Id.)
   
   Over the past several years, Bell and McCullagh have communicated
   irregularly, mostly by telephone. Some of the information provided to
   McCullagh by Bell has resulted in news stories; some has not, but
   might be used in future stories. (Id.  7.) McCullagh carefully
   retains information that he gathers as a journalist until it is useful
   for published articles. (Id.  8.) It is McCullagh's belief that
   sources speak to him and cooperate with his newsgathering efforts
   because he is trustworthy and independent. (Id.)
   
   Some of McCullagh's sources already have told him that they will stop
   assisting him or providing him with information if he testifies in
   Bell's trial. (Id.  9.) Of particular concern to McCullagh is the
   likely loss of sources who respect him for his independence and who,
   in some circumstances, are challenging the authorities on issues
   relating to Internet freedom. (Id.) These sources, who have given
   McCullagh information that was vital to covering all sides of Internet
   issues, are likely to view McCullagh (erroneously) in the future as an
   agent for the government if he is compelled to testify for the
   prosecution in this trial. (Id..)
   
   McCullagh also fears that testifying about unpublished information
   will jeopardize his credibility as a journalist. (Id.  10.) Many
   people who have provided McCullagh with information have done so on
   the understanding that he was working as a reporter, and not gathering
   information for litigants. (Id.) The information that he receives from
   sources leads him to other sources and additional information;
   disclosure of his newsgathering techniques and practices will put him
   at a competitive disadvantage in the future. (Id.) McCullagh believes
   that disclosure of his work product could compromise his reputation as
   an impartial journalist and a communicator of news, and create the
   false perception that McCullagh can be used by litigants as a
   collector and presenter of information helpful to their causes. (Id.)
   
   3.
       THE SUBPOENA SHOULD BE QUASHED BECAUSE IT IS UNREASONABLE AND
       OPPRESSIVE
       
   While the government has indicated its willingness to limit
   McCullagh's testimony to verification of the accuracy of published
   statements made by Bell, putting McCullagh on the witness stand
   necessarily raises the possibility that Bell will challenge
   McCullagh's testimony on direct by inquiring into unpublished matters.
   Indeed, Bell's lawyer has informed counsel for McCullagh that Bell
   will want to obtain testimony from McCullagh because Bell considers
   McCullagh to be sympathetic to him. Bell apparently hopes to bring
   before the jury Bell's allegations of government wrongdoing by asking
   McCullagh to testify about Bell's conversations with McCullagh, and to
   disclose any research McCullagh might have conducted relating to
   Bell's theories and accusations.
   
   Such testimony is irrelevant to the charges of interstate stalking for
   which Bell is on trial. The government's need for Bell's published
   statements is tenuous at best: the quotations in the Articles appear
   to be rhetoric; they offer no evidence that Bell crossed a state line
   with the intention of injuring or harassing alleged victims Mike
   McNall and Jeff Gordon.
   
   Further, the likely inquiry by Bell that follows from McCullagh's
   verification of the quotations in the Articles is not relevant at all.
   Rather, it merely distracts the jury from the charges at issue while
   compelling McCullagh to describe his collection of information from
   numerous sources, and his selection of material for publication. Put
   simply, Bell's likely cross-examination of McCullagh will be a fishing
   expedition in its purest form. The "mere hope" of obtaining
   exculpatory evidence is not sufficient for enforcement of a Rule 17
   subpoena. United States v. Cuthbertson, 630 F.2d 139, 146 (3d Cir.
   1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1126 (1981) ("Cuthbertson I").
   
   Thus, an evaluation of the profound impact of the subpoena on
   McCullagh establishes that the subpoena is unreasonable and
   oppressive, in violation of Rule 17. The threatened intrusion into the
   newsgathering process requires an order quashing the subpoena in its
   entirety.
   
   4.
       THE SUBPOENA SHOULD BE QUASHED, OR A PROTECTIVE ORDER ENTERED,
       BECAUSE UNPUBLISHED INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST
       AMENDMENT
       A. The Burden Imposed By Subpoenas Such As The One At Issue Here
       Has Caused The Courts To Extend The Privilege To Unpublished
       Information
       
   In Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 707 (1972), the United States
   Supreme Court recognized that journalists' newsgathering activities
   qualify for protection under the First Amendment to the United States
   Constitution. The Court concluded that "without some protection for
   seeking out the news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated." Id.
   at 681. Justice Powell, in casting the deciding fifth vote, stated
   that "[t]he Court does not hold that newsmen, subpoenaed to testify
   before a grand jury, are without constitutional rights with respect to
   the gathering of news or in the safeguarding of their sources." Id. at
   709 (Powell, J., concurring). Although the Court did not permit the
   reporters in the Branzburg case to refuse to appear and testify before
   grand juries, federal courts have interpreted Branzburg as recognizing
   a qualified privilege that protects information gathered by
   journalists in preparation for new s reports, but which has not been
   published. See, e.g., Cuthbertson I, 630 F.2d at 146-47; Von Bulow v.
   Von Bulow, 811 F.2d 136, 143 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. LaRouche
   Campaign, 841 F.2d 1176, 1181-82 (1st Cir. 1988).
   
   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has
   recognized this First Amendment privilege in the context of criminal
   proceedings, Farr v. Pitchess, 522 F.2d 464, 467-68 (9th Cir. 1975),
   cert. denied, 427 U.S. 912 (1976), and has held that the privilege
   protects unpublished information, even if it is not obtained under an
   agreement of confidentiality, Shoen v. Shoen, 5 F.3d 1289, 1295 (9th
   Cir. 1993) ("Shoen I"). A court must weigh any claim of First
   Amendment privilege against the need for disclosure and strike a
   balance in favor of the "paramount interest." Farr, 522 F.2d at 468.
   
   The Ninth Circuit explained in Shoen I that "the privilege is a
   recognition that society's interest in protecting the integrity of the
   newsgathering process, and in ensuring the free flow of information to
   the public, is an interest `of sufficient social importance to justify
   some incidental sacrifice of sources of facts needed in the
   administration of justice.'" 5 F.3d at 1292 (quoting Herbert v. Lando,
   441 U.S. 153, 183 (Brennan, J., dissenting).). Protection of
   unpublished information is critical to freedom of speech, even where
   it is not gained under a promise of confidentiality, because routine
   demands for such information in court will interfere with journalists'
   work and independence. The Ninth Circuit stated:
   
   "The . . . four interests named are the threat of administrative and
       judicial intrusion into the newsgathering and editorial process;
       the disadvantage of a journalist appearing to be an investigative
       arm of the judicial system or a research tool of government or of
       a private party; the disincentive to compile and preserve
       non-broadcast material; and the burden on journalists' time and
       resources in responding to subpoenas." . . .
       To the extent that compelled disclosure becomes commonplace, it
       seems likely indeed that internal policies of destruction of
       materials may be devised and choices as to subject matter made,
       which could be keyed to avoiding disclosure requests or compliance
       therewith rather than to the basic function of providing news and
       comment. In addition, frequency of subpoenas would not only
       preempt the otherwise productive time of journalists and other
       employees but measurably increase expenditures for legal fees.
       
   Id.
   at 1294-95 (quoting LaRouche Campaign, 841 F.2d at 1182).
   
   The Ninth Circuit concluded that requiring journalists to testify
   impedes their ability to collect information, and thereby chills
   speech.
   
   "It is their independent status that often enables reporters to gain
       access, without a pledge of confidentiality, to meetings or places
       where a policeman or a politician would not be welcome. If
       perceived as an adjunct of the police or of the courts,
       journalists might well be shunned by persons who might otherwise
       give them information without a promise of confidentiality, barred
       from meetings which they would otherwise be free to attend and to
       describe, or even physically harassed if, for example, observed
       taking notes or photographs at a public rally.
       
   Id.
   at 1295 (quoting Duane D. Morse & John W. Zucker, The Journalist's
   Privilege in Testimonial Privileges (Scott N. Stone & Ronald S.
   Liebman eds., 1983), at 474-75).
   
   The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in Cuthbertson, a
   criminal case:
   
   We do not think that the privilege can be limited solely to protection
       of sources. The compelled production of a reporter's resource
       materials can constitute a significant intrusion into the
       newsgathering and editorial processes. See Loadholtz v. Fields,
       389 F. Supp. 1299, 1303 (M.D. Fla. 1975). Like the compelled
       disclosure of confidential sources, it may substantially undercut
       the public policy favoring the free flow of information to the
       public that is the foundation for the privilege. See Riley v. City
       of Chester, [612 F.2d 708, 716 (3d Cir. 1979)]. Therefore, we hold
       that the privilege extends to unpublished materials in the
       possession of CBS. See Altemose Construction Co. v. Building &
       Construction Trades Council, 443 F. Supp. 489, 491 (E.D. Pa. 1977)
       ("this qualified privilege can even apply when the news source
       and, perhaps, a portion of the withheld writing, are not
       confidential").
       
   Cuthbertson,
   630 F.2d at 147.
   
   Democracy's keystone is the dissemination of information to the
   public, permitting it to make informed choices. This dissemination
   depends on journalists who are successful in gathering facts, and
   that, in turn, depends on sources who will not disclose information
   unless they believe they are dealing with professionals who are
   trustworthy and objective. By compelling a journalist to disclose work
   product whenever a litigant views it as helpful to his or her case, a
   court sacrifices the very First Amendment freedoms that keep our
   nation informed and our government accountable.
   
   B. The First Amendment Privilege Can Be Overcome In Only The
       Most Limited Of Circumstances
       
   Recognizing the threat that compulsory disclosure of work product
   posed to the uninhibited flow of information, the Ninth Circuit
   adopted a three-part test that courts must apply whenever a journalist
   withholds unpublished information that was not gained under a promise
   of confidentiality. The test's purpose, the court explained, was to
   "ensure that compelled disclosure is the exception, not the rule."
   Shoen v. Shoen, 48 F.3d 412 (9th Cir. 1995) ("Shoen II").
   
   We . . . hold that where information sought is not confidential, a
       civil litigant is entitled to requested discovery notwithstanding
       a valid assertion of the journalist's privilege by a nonparty only
       upon a showing that the requested material is: (1) unavailable
       despite exhaustion of all reasonable alternative sources;
       (2) noncumulative; and (3) clearly relevant to an important issue
       in the case. We note that there must be a showing of actual
       relevance; a showing of potential relevance will not suffice.
       
   Id.
   
   Although the Ninth Circuit has not had the opportunity to apply the
   three-part test of Shoen II in a criminal case, the Third Circuit has
   adopted a nearly identical test and applied it to a criminal subpoena
   that sought unpublished, nonconfidential information:
   
   "First, the movant must demonstrate that he has made an effort to
       obtain the information from other sources. Second, he must
       demonstrate that the only access to the information sought is
       through the journalist and her sources. Finally, the movant must
       persuade the Court that the information sought is crucial to the
       claim."
       
   United States v. Cuthbertson,
   651 F.2d 189, 195-96 (3d Cir.) ("Cuthbertson II") (quoting United
   States v. Criden, 633 F.2d 346, 358-59 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied,
   449 U.S. 113 (1981)), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1056 (1981).
   
   Application of the First Amendment privilege in a criminal proceeding
   is just as important as in a civil context. As the Second Circuit held
   in United States v. Burke, 700 F.2d 70, 76 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,
   464 U.S. 816 (1983): "[T]he important social interests in the free
   flow of information that are protected by the reporter's qualified
   privilege are particularly compelling in criminal cases. Reporters are
   to be encouraged to investigate and expose, free from unnecessary
   government intrusion, evidence of criminal wrongdoing."
   
   C. The Privilege Protects Unpublished Information In McCullagh's
       Possession,
       And Cannot Be Overcome By Bell
       
   If Bell attempts to cross-examine McCullagh regarding unpublished
   information, he cannot satisfy any of the Shoen requirements, let
   alone all three of them. Only by meeting all of the requirements can
   Bell establish the kind of "compelling need" that overcomes the First
   Amendment privilege. Shoen I, 5 F.3d at 1196.
   
   First
   , Bell cannot establish that he exhausted all alternative sources for
   the information he might hope to obtain from McCullagh. Testimony
   about Bell's conversations with McCullagh can be provided by Bell
   himself. See, e.g., Shoen I, 5 F.3d at 1296 (refusing to order author
   to produce notes of interview with party because the party was an
   alternative source for the information); Carushka, Inc. v. Premiere
   Products, Inc., 1989 U.S. Dist. Lexis 17487, *8, 17 Media L. Rep. 2001
   (C.D. Cal 1989) (refusing to order magazine publisher to produce
   unpublished materials; "as the information sought was either provided
   by or adopted by plaintiff, defendants may elicit the relevant
   testimony from plaintiff herself").
   
   Even assuming that testimony by McCullagh about his conversations with
   people other than Bell is admissible, that information is available
   from the other participants in the conversations. For example, if Bell
   contends that McCullagh obtained information from federal agents, Bell
   can obtain that testimony from the federal agents. Indeed, it is
   difficult to fathom what information McCullagh might have gathered
   that is even remotely relevant to this trial that is not readily
   available from other witnesses who will be called by the government or
   who are subject to subpoena by the defense. See Cuthbertson II, 651
   F.2d at 196 (privilege does not yield unless "the only practical
   access to the information sought is through the media source). Bell's
   inability to meet this requirement of exhaustion, on its own, dooms
   any effort to pierce the First Amendment privilege. See Shoen I, 5
   F.3d at 1296 ("At a minimum, [the requesting party must make] a
   showing that the information sought is not obtainable from another
   resource."); accord Carey v. Hume, 492 F.2d 631, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1974)
   (compelled disclosure from a journalist must be a "last resort after
   pursuit of other opportunities has failed"), cert. dismissed, 417 U.S.
   938 (1974).
   
   Second
   , the information that Bell might seek from McCullagh is cumulative.
   Bell will have the opportunity to cross-examine the government's
   witnesses, and to call his own witnesses, in an effort to establish
   that he was unfairly targeted by the government or the victim of a
   conspiracy. Simply put, whatever Bell told McCullagh, and whatever
   information McCullagh gathered as a result of Bell's statements to
   McCullagh, is evidence that Bell will present through other witnesses,
   including himself if he takes the stand. Any intrusion on McCullagh's
   newsgathering and Wired News' editorial decisions is unjustified,
   given the cumulative nature of the evidence Bell is likely to seek
   from McCullagh. See, e.g., United States v. Hubbard, 493 F. Supp. 202,
   205 (D.D.C. 1979) (quashing subpoena by criminal defendant on ground
   that other witnesses were available for same facts, making reporters'
   testimony "merely cumulative"). 
   
   Third
   , the unpublished information Bell is likely to attempt to elicit on
   cross-examination is not clearly and actually relevant to an important
   issue of the case. As the Second Circuit explained in Burke, unless a
   criminal defendant who seeks to pierce the privilege can make a "clear
   and specific showing" that the evidence is "necessary or critical to
   the maintenance of his defense," the reporter's privilege will be
   upheld. Burke, 700 F.2d at 77. Bell's unpublished communications with
   McCullagh do not go directly to the issue of whether he engaged in
   interstate stalking of federal agents. Communications between
   McCullagh and others relating to Bell's case would be inadmissible
   hearsay, or, if they involve federal agents, would be merely
   impeachment evidence, which is not evidence that is considered
   "critical or necessary to the maintenance or defense of a claim." See
   In Re Application to Quash Subpoena, 79 F.3d 346, 352 (2d Cir. 1996).
   And McCullagh's actions (any research he might have done) are
   completely irrelevant. Indeed, communications with reporters, and what
   reporters might have done with that information, will undoubtedly
   confuse the issues, delay the proceedings, and waste time. See Fed. R.
   Evid. 403; see also National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Seafirst Corp.,
   1987 U.S. Dist. Lexis 16094, *4-5, 14 Media L. Rep. 1190 (W.D. Wash.
   1987) (quashing subpoena seeking unpublished information because
   communications between defendant and reporters were only "marginally
   relevant at best," even though contents of article were important to
   case).
   
   Further, to allow the privilege to be invaded here would set a
   terrible precedent. To allow a defendant to cross-examine a reporter
   about privileged matters simply because the government has asked a
   reporter about non-privileged matters would eviscerate the privilege.
   Every time the subject matter of a news article became the subject
   matter of a trial, newsgathering activities would become fair game for
   the litigants. It is this very concern - that journalists will be
   routinely subjected to subpoenas - that caused the Ninth Circuit to
   hold that "compelled disclosure is the exception, not the rule." Shoen
   II, 48 F.3d at 416.
   
   5.
       CONCLUSION
       
   In extending the journalist's privilege to unpublished information,
   the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized "that routine court-compelled
   disclosure of research materials poses a serious threat to the
   vitality of the newsgathering process." Shoen II, 48 F.3d at 415-16.
   
   Accordingly, reporter Declan McCullagh requests that the Court quash
   the subpoena, or, alternatively, enter a protective order that
   prohibits counsel from inquiring into any matters other than the
   published contents of the articles.
