This is farcical, but one more round lest silence be taken as tacit agreement.  For those of you who can't efficiently process 
unwanted email, apologies.  And consider getting a better email client + plugins.

Not really, more from warlords, dictators, etc.  Supposedly Russia is "only protecting their ethnic Russians".  From what?  Joining 
NATO and Western Europe as far as I could tell.

Yep, the US has been involved in all kinds of past situations, along with a number of other countries.  Those were indeed the bad 
old days.  Sometimes intentions were good, sometimes maybe not.  It's too bad that people 40-80 years ago didn't have 2015 
sensibilities. Romans begat Europe, British begat a lot, including terrible treatment of Aborigines and Maori.  Europe decimated 
American Indians.  Slavery.  But you imply that past possibly-poor actions indicate present value.  Hardly.  None of those people 
are in power and most are dead.  Everyone has learned a lot, J. Edgar Hoover is no longer blackmailing US Presidents and everyone 
else to preserve his FBI empire, etc.  Americans beat up on America quite a bit and all of this eventually comes out, often these 
days as very watchable movies that authoritatively teach what we weren't taught in school, about the US and often the rest of the 
world.  Generally, lessons are learned and we do better in the future.  But occasionally someone slips in who is not an intellectual 
powerhouse and mistakes are made again.  Se la vie.  What's your better alternative?

Even when the US meddled, except for a very few circumstances, it was to achieve something useful, not to subjugate peoples for 
colonies, incorporation into an empire, etc.  The US pays a lot for legacy military bases everywhere, provides lots of protection 
and other benefits, and generally attempts fit in and be respectful.

What is your concept?  That no one have power to repel anyone else? That some other country / culture is better suited to being "on 
top"?  The US is the worst system, except for everything else.  It is deliberately designed to be messy, in conflict, and unstable. 
The genius of this arrangement is that it leads to a stronger result than anything else.

Many non-Americans don't really get America, even if they have visited or lived here.  Many Americans don't fully get America 
either; easy to be parochial.

Not long ago, someone was tearing into the US about teargas being used in some situation, how terrible and dangerous it was, etc.  I 
pointed out, with references, that every single American military individual is subjected to a good dose of teargas as part of training.

In some cases, regime change can be nice.  Depends on specifics.

Yea?  Interesting.  I think you've been watching Fox News too much. Or you are talking about New Jersey.  ;-)
We obsess about that stuff precisely because it isn't tolerated at all, except for narrowly acceptable, mostly noise levels.

How do you come to think this?  What's your evidence?

Yea?  What would constitute a fall for the US?  I don't think you understand the nature of the US or what would constitute a win.

Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a group definitely think were mistakes, Iraq etc.

What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it 
wasn't "stopped"?

Your construction there seems off, but:

Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII, 
etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong 
on multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US, they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. 
Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.

"Capture the sanction of foreign thinkers"? Nonsense.

few are going to go off the rails occasionally. That's a
bummer, and needs to be constantly protected against, but there's no obvious
alternative.

The US is the least imperialist top superpower that ever existed. Still not
perfect, but better than all the rest.

    Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a

I just pray that the end of USA's grab for global hegemony means a
long lasting multi-polar world, and not a new imperialist Chinese

    What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony
    would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it wasn't
    "stopped"?<br>

You're missing the point. "Regime change" means if you're in their
way, your life ends. Time for you to do some history lessons. Because
you feel safe (you're one of the "good guys" right?), you don't see
the problem, and you therefore have difficulty hearing the message.</pre>

    Your construction there seems off, but:<br>
    <br>
    Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or
    indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII,
    etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed
    real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong on
    multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US,
    they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. 
    Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.<br>
