<p><b>QUESTIONS:</b>
<p>From: LBailey&nbsp;&nbsp; - lbailey@softwarescene.com
<br>Subject: Any help with Cold Fusion?
<p>One of the web sites I administer was developed with
<br>Cold Fusion 4.0.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the developer is no
<br>longer around.
<p>I need to know how to code the index.cfm pages, so that
<br>the long path name does not display in the browser's
<br>address box.&nbsp; I often have links from advertisers to
<br>this site that are long and ugly.
<p>Ex: mydomain.com/sale/brand/index.cfm?source=goto
<p>Can you help?&nbsp; Any and all information will be greatly
<br>appreciated.

<br>Subject:&nbsp; Ways to accept credit cards
<p>>From: richard burgess - suwat54@yahoo.com
<br>>Subject: Connecting credit card payments to site? (Issue #426)
<br>>
<br>-- >I have been enjoying and learning via your information -
<br>thank you. Now I am almost ready to launch my internet
<br>business, but as I am quite naive to this, I can't
<br>seem to find a way to connect visa or other credit
<br>cards for payment for my service. &lt; --
<p>Hello Richard,
<p>There are quite a few ways to set up for credit cards.
<p>1. CCNow, they do everything for you and send any sales you
<br>have on the 1st and 15th of the month. All this for 9% of the sale,
<br>go to their site at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.ccnow.com/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I use them and
<br>have been pretty happy with them so far.
<p>2. PayPal is another option to be able to take credit card on your
<br>website. Set up their shopping cart and for 2% and $.30 on each
<br>transaction, don't think you can beat it,&nbsp; if your going to be
doing
<br>business on E-Bay or one of the other auctions you will need
<br>something like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.paypal.com/
<p>The above are for small business just starting out on the internet,
<br>no monthly charges, no set up fees, just a percentage of each sale.
<br>If you are actually doing a large volume business there are other
<br>methods for monthly fees that are reasonable.
<p>I have used both of the methods described above and been very
<br>happy with both. The next update on my site will reflect the paypal
<br>features I have just added.
<p>Hope this helps

<p><b>THANKS FOR REVIEW!</b>
<p>From: All Biz Services&nbsp;&nbsp; - patty@allbizservices.com
<br>Subject: Thanks - already incorporating changes!
<p>Thanks so much for the review, comments and suggestions!
<br>Have changed a few things already, including the addition
<br>of my photo (ugh!)&nbsp; You are absolutely right, however,
<br>people do buy from people, not machines!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I tried to make the Order Here process more prominent
<br>and also changed the PPPS to an email forward with
<br>an autoresponder.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The only thing left to do is to create a logo. This is
<br>truly something I've been struggling with.&nbsp; Not the
<br>how, I can do that, it's the what?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Ah well, one step at a time, right?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Thanks again,
<br>&nbsp;

I use them and
<br>have been pretty happy with them so far.
<p>2. PayPal is another option to be able to take credit card on your
<br>website. Set up their shopping cart and for 2% and $.30 on each
<br>transaction, don't think you can beat it,&nbsp; if your going to be
doing
<br>business on E-Bay or one of the other auctions you will need
<br>something like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.paypal.com/
<p>The above are for small business just starting out on the internet,
<br>no monthly charges, no set up fees, just a percentage of each sale.
<br>If you are actually doing a large volume business there are other
<br>methods for monthly fees that are reasonable.
<p>I have used both of the methods described above and been very
<br>happy with both. The next update on my site will reflect the paypal
<br>features I have just added.
<p>Hope this helps

<p><b>THANKS FOR REVIEW!</b>
<p>From: All Biz Services&nbsp;&nbsp; - patty@allbizservices.com
<br>Subject: Thanks - already incorporating changes!
<p>Thanks so much for the review, comments and suggestions!
<br>Have changed a few things already, including the addition
<br>of my photo (ugh!)&nbsp; You are absolutely right, however,
<br>people do buy from people, not machines!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I tried to make the Order Here process more prominent
<br>and also changed the PPPS to an email forward with
<br>an autoresponder.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The only thing left to do is to create a logo. This is
<br>truly something I've been struggling with.&nbsp; Not the
<br>how, I can do that, it's the what?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Ah well, one step at a time, right?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Thanks again,
<br>&nbsp;
