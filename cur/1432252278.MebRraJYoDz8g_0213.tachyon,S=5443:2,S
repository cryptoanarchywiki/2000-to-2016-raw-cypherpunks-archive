An interesting thread concerning M-o-o-t can be found at 
http://www.topica.com/lists/m-o-o-t-os-group/read

Of particular interest to cypherpunks may be the "Threats and Weaknesses" 
analysis begun in Dec 2000

Threats and Weaknesses
======================

Workstation:
 Hardware/firmware traps either built-in or add-on (eg
keystroke data capture plugs)
 Execution on a virtual machine designed to compromise the
application
 Surveillance techniques (camera, electronic monitoring,
"Tempest")
 Trojan horse software via doctored compiler
 Trojan horse software via doctored CD

Server:
 Undetected impostors or other subversion of security
software
 Key captures
 Billing/Account/Payment tracing and trawling

Network:
 Denial of service attacks on the havens
 DNS and routing attacks (eg via ARPS, spoofing etc)
 false packet etc protocol attacks
 traffic analysis
 monkey in the middle attacks

User:
 Criminalise this product
 Criminalise encryption
 Problem of creating a personal identifier that cannot be
copied, forged or usurped by force
 Billing systems may expose usage details

Data:
 Data entry and exit to the unsecure world - need to have
anonymous methods for this
 Is the data going to be locked up too tightly to be
useful?
 Can the data be manageable but still secure? Eg,
individual directories may be necessary but a security
risk. If there is no good built-in management system,
people will create hazardous insecure out-of-system ones.

 How can data availability be guaranteed over long periods
of time?

Encryption:
 How can keys be securely created, managed and protected
from mis-use?
 Are there sufficiently top-class cryptographers on tap to
implement new secure systems?

Project:
 Is it too ambitious for the resources?
 Can it be staged to produce useful (and profitable)
subsets more quickly?
 Does it conflict with other similar developments?
 Can it be managed in an insecure environment in a
jurisdiction that is hostile to its purpose?
