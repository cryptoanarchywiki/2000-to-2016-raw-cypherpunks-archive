Forget About The Cow, Brand The Customer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

When you think of branding, the first thing that must come 
to mind is a farmer taking a hot iron and burning a distinctive   
mark onto the side of a cow.  Farmers do this so that their   
cows will not be confused with another farmer's cows.  

But branding has evolved over the years and has now 
become a common term used in marketing.  Branding is 
essentially burning your company or web site name or 
slogan into the minds of potential customers.  

Many offline companies have been quite successful in doing 
this.  Kleenex is a brand name for tissue as is Band-Aid for 
adhesive bandages.  These companies have incorporated 
into the customer's mind to perceive these items by their 
brand name.  Branding is important on the Internet, especially 
with all the cut-throat competition.    

In the real world, it may be just a matter of convenience   
why some people shop at a closer discount store than going 
that extra mile to the next discount store.  But on the Internet, 
any web site is just a click away.  You need to differentiate   
yourself from the rest.  Branding can create this difference.  

One of the most important decisions when it comes to branding 
is deciding the domain name that you want to use.  You want to 
pick a name that is short and snappy that will "stick" into the 
minds of visitors and potential customers.  

I remember about a year ago, a few Internet marketers were   
making a huge hoopla about the domain names that allowed you 
to have 67 characters.  This fad has died down because people 
are not going to remember long names such as:  

www.marketing-reports-that-will-make-you-money-fast.com  

People find it easy to retain short URL's such as yahoo.com,   
snap.com or eBay.com.  You should pick a name that is short 
and yet at the same time will give a potential visitor an idea 
as to what you are all about.  

For example, if you pick a name such as www.autolube.com, 
people will automatically associate your name with automobiles 
and oil.  

Branding can be also used in slogans.  I bet you can pick out   
these companies real quick:  

1. "Quality is Job 1."  

2. "Finger-lickin' good."  

3. "The milk chocolate melts in your mouth - not in your hand."  

4. "Have it your way."  

5. "It keeps going, and going, and going..."  

If you guessed Ford, KFC, M & M's, Burger King, and Energizer,   
then you probably understand the importance of branding.  

If you decide to use a slogan for your web site, researchers   
have suggested that rhymes are easy to remember.  For example:  

"We are number one, because we like to have fun..."  

Okay, that was kind of cheesy.  But you get the point. ;)  

Another method of branding is with your online classified ads.   
If you use consistent headlines and words in your ads, then   
customers will be able to identify the ad to your web site or   
company very quickly when they see it again.  

Statistics indicate that customers need to see an online   
advertisement at least seven times before they will buy.  If you   
are constantly changing your ads for no valid reason, you may 
be losing your identity with potential customers.  

One of the best books written on online branding is "Revenge 
of Brand X", written by Rob Frankel.  

Rob really goes in depth about branding and his book covers 
a lot of detail.  You can purchase a copy by going to:  

http://www.freecoolcash.com/cgi-bin/lnkinlte.cgi?l=brandx  

The Internet has created a level playing field for all   
competitors.  Competitors need to differentiate themselves 
to win the customer.  A good brand name translates into a 
bigger market share on the Internet.  A bigger market share 
means larger sales and bigger profits.  

Now forget about cows when it comes to branding and get   
moooooooooooooooving... I know, I know, that was even 
more cheesy.

Commentary Quick Tips

Words of Wisdom:

I hope I don't offend anyone with this! It just seems that, unless 
you are already successful, no one listens to what you have to 
say! 

I'd like to remind people that some of the greatest minds in 
history, such as Albert Einstein were not only poor, but 
considered to be crazy! Sometimes its the "little people" who 
have the most to share! It doesn't always take an EXPENSIVE 
product to generate a LOT OF $$$ - look at the PET ROCK!!! 
What was the cost or education required for that??? A little 
creativity can go a LONG WAY!!

<p>I hope I don't offend anyone with this! It just seems that,
<br>unless you are already successful, no one listens to what
<br>you have to say!
<p>I'd like to remind people that some of the greatest minds in
<br>history, such as Albert Einstein were not only poor, but
<br>considered to be crazy! Sometimes its the "little people" who
<br>have the most to share! It doesn't always take an EXPENSIVE
<br>product to generate a LOT OF $$$ - look at the PET ROCK!!!
<br>What was the cost or education required for that??? A little
<br>creativity can go a LONG WAY!!

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>I try not to subscribe to every mailing list and ignore spam
<br>so I am able to read less than 40 emails per day. I do believe
<br>that there's more to life than having to deal with all those
<br>emails, which can take literally hours. If I do get more
<br>(and if that becomes the norm), I'll find myself an assistant.
