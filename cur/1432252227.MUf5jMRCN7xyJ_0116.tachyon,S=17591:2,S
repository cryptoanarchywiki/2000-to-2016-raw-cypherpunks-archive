this action !!!
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.
It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the 
Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will 
be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% 
(100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 
45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.
You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump made an 
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost 
everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find 
a good network marketing company and get to work. 
The audience started to hoot and boo him.
He looked out at the audience and deadpanned his response "That's why I'm sitting up 
here and you are all sitting out there!"
With network marketing you have two sources of income.  Direct commissions from sales 
you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the 
business.
Residual income is the secret of the wealthy.
It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again. In 
network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others.  The enclosed 
information is something I almost let slip through my fingers.  
HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF 
DOLLAR$ INSTRUCTIONS:
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you 
could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.
Before you say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully.
This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal
money making opportunity.
Basically, this is what you do: As with all
multi-level businesses,
we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.
Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer 
a product for EVERY dollar sent.
YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved 
in personal selling.
You do it privately in your own home, store or office.  This is the GREATEST Multi-Level 
Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do:
1.	Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't order 
them).
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE 
ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL AND ADDRESS, YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in 
case of a problem) and to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY 
MAIL PROBLEMS!
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports. You will need 
all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.
* Within a few days you will receive, via
E-mail, each of the four reports. Save them on your
computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's
of people who will order them from you.
2.	IMPORTANT-DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each 
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" 
through "f" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way 
this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it.  Remember, this method has 
been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.
a.	Look below for the listing of available
reports.
b.	After you've ordered the four reports, take
this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has 
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!
c.	Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.
d.	Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.
e.	Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.
f.	Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.
Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!
3.	Take this entire letter, including the modified
list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of 
this letter.
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You 
obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!  To assist you with 
marketing your business on the Internet, the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with 
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.
There are two primary methods of building your downline:
METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see 
how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs 
each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list the 
response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But 
continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that 
is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs 
each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2.
Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that 
is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 
2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is 10,000 orders For REPORT #4. That's 
10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!!
Your total income in this example is
$50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS 
ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF-SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD 
OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to 
participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have an Internet connection 
and e-mail is FREE!  REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing, tell you 
where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists.
METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
1.	Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of 
FREE places to advertise.  Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. 
Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of 
FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone 
else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.
Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:
1st level-your 10 members with $5...$50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)...$500 3rd level-10 members from those 100 
($5 x 1,000) $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) $50,000 THIS 
TOTALS ---------------------------$55,550 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who 
participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 
20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!
For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S 
IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that 
the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they 
can't advertise until they receive the report!

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******
* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions 
accurately.
* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start 
coming in because:
When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report.
* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your 
results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!
* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow these guidelines to guarantee your 
success:
If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or 
sending e-mails until you do.
Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If 
you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because 
the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT 
report.
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering 
from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue 
placing ads and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will 
generate from this business!
