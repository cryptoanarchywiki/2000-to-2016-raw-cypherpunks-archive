<p>QUESTIONS:
<p>From: webmaster&nbsp; - webmaster@rajasthanhandicrafts.com
<br>Subject: How to find free targeted audience?
<p>I have this website which was launched about a year ago. This
<br>website features handcrafted products from the wonderful land
<br>of Rajasthan and the range and quality of products are not only
<br>unique but also very attractive.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The problem is that I have been submitting to search engines and
<br>FFA, and I average about 15 to 20 hits per day, but this is not
<br>translating into business. What I need is targeted email addresses
<br>of the wholesalers, importers and those who are interested in such
<br>products.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Further since I am based in India where remittance of US Dollars
<br>are restricted and controlled, it becomes very difficult to rent or
<br>buy targeted email lists or directories of relevant importers.I have
<br>great faith in the products we carry and am sure that proper
<br>exposure to the right audience will result in huge sales and
<br>business, but this problem has tied me down. Even though I
<br>am marketing incredible products, but in absence of right targeting,
<br>it is little use.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Can you suggest how to go about it?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Looking forward to your positive reply. Thanks!

<p>Error messages can happen for lots of reasons, including
<br>that you may be connecting too slowly to the web server
<br>you are trying to reach. Or, the problem could be with your
<br>computer hardware limitations or the version of explorer
<br>you are using.
<p>You would also need to mention if the problem just
<br>started, if you've made any changes to your settings, or
<br>if this is an ongoing problem.&nbsp; Give some more details and
<br>I might be able to be more specific.

<p>SITE REVIEWED
<p>Comments on Site #127: <a href="http://www.allbizservices.com/win">http://www.allbizservices.com/win</a>
<br>Patty Baldwin
<br>patty@allbizservices.com
<br>~~~~
<p>This is a very simple but effective site. Patty is selling her
<br>sales copy services, and I think she does an excellent job
<br>outlining her points, giving benefits, reasons, things to
<br>look for, etc.
<p>The only thing I'd suggest is the 'All Biz Services' at the top
<br>could be made into a more memorable logo or graphic,
<br>and I would have liked to see a photo of her.
<br>~~~~
<p>Straightforward site. You can't get more focused than this.
<br>~~~~
<p>I found the sales copy on this website very compelling, and
<br>came away with the idea Patty knows what she's talking about.
<br>But, she mentions asking for samples, and I think it would
<br>have been appropriate to see samples (besides this page) of
<br>her previous work.
<p>Links are limited, and I felt led through the site up until the end.
<br>At the end though, the highlighted email address took me to
<br>another website instead of opening my email, I had forgotten
<br>the description for the newsletter so still wasn't sure I wanted
<br>to sign up, and almost missed the order information since I
<br>had to read through to the end before I would think about
<br>ordering.
<br>~~~~
<p>Nice site. Had all the right stuff - good sales copy that spoke
<br>to me personally, complete contact information with an
<br>explanation for using a PO box, no distracting graphics or
<br>links. I would definitely consider using allbizservices in the
<br>future.

<p>SITE REVIEWED
<p>Comments on Site #127: <a href="http://www.allbizservices.com/win">http://www.allbizservices.com/win</a>

<br>~~~~
<p>This is a very simple but effective site. Patty is selling her
<br>sales copy services, and I think she does an excellent job
<br>outlining her points, giving benefits, reasons, things to
<br>look for, etc.
<p>The only thing I'd suggest is the 'All Biz Services' at the top
<br>could be made into a more memorable logo or graphic,
<br>and I would have liked to see a photo of her.
<br>~~~~
<p>Straightforward site. You can't get more focused than this.
<br>~~~~
<p>I found the sales copy on this website very compelling, and
<br>came away with the idea Patty knows what she's talking about.
<br>But, she mentions asking for samples, and I think it would
<br>have been appropriate to see samples (besides this page) of
<br>her previous work.
<p>Links are limited, and I felt led through the site up until the end.
<br>At the end though, the highlighted email address took me to
<br>another website instead of opening my email, I had forgotten
<br>the description for the newsletter so still wasn't sure I wanted
<br>to sign up, and almost missed the order information since I
<br>had to read through to the end before I would think about
<br>ordering.
<br>~~~~
<p>Nice site. Had all the right stuff - good sales copy that spoke
<br>to me personally, complete contact information with an
<br>explanation for using a PO box, no distracting graphics or
<br>links. I would definitely consider using allbizservices in the
<br>future.
