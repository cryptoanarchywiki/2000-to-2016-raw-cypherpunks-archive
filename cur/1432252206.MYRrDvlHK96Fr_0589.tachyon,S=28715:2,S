CPM means cost per thousand. For example, if you purchase 
10,000 banner impressions at $10 CPM, you'll end up paying 
$100.

Hello Terry,

I'm sure John will reply too, but I have to put in my 2c's worth. 
The biggest difference you will experience as a Linux user is the 
amount of help and assistance that is available. If you join your 
local LUG (Linux Users Group) you may end up with a house 
full of helpful geeks! horrors!  Linux newbies are treated with 
a deference never accorded to WIndows newbies.

None of your M$ flavour software operates under Linux but that 
is really no hardship as the quantity and quality of USEFUL 
software is very extensive. To preview such offerings go to 
http://freshmeat.net/  there are many other sites that offer Linux 
software but this is everyones favourite starting place.

Hardware can present a problem if you have Win specific items. 
I have a Brother PC label maker that requires Windows so I am 
stuck with a dual boot machine until I can sort it

HTH.  Tony.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #144:  http://www.tpcenterprises.com/
info@tpcenterprises.com
~~~~

There was a lot of information there.  The links were useful and 
worked just fine.  I felt the only way to understand what was 
happening would be to print off information and read it ON 
PAPER OFFLINE.
~~~~

At first glance this is an extremely well designed site. 
Navigation is easy, color choices are great and no blatant errors. 

However after spending over 10 minutes going through the site 
for several pages and checking the Questions and Answers page 
and finally going to the order page before I could find out the 
cost and possibly order the " sales kit ". 

I find that the offer is not for anyone except US citizens - therefore 
eliminating and alienating over 1/2 the internet .. ( Yes the US is 
important but the internet is a WORLD WIDE web - about 55% 
are not American. IF the product is not available anywhere else 
except in the US at this time.  State that  on your opening page. 
You may expand your market later to involve the majority of 
Internet users who are Not living in the USA and might mention 
that. The way it reads now you have P'd off anyone that had an 
interest in your proposition and went to the trouble of going 
through your presentation only to find that they can't order it.
~~~~

Overall design plan is good in navigation and viewing, but it 
is lacking in pictures.  Although graphics can slow a page 
down some, it makes the reader want to read.   So add some 
well placed graphics and maybe some pullquotes.   The title 
"Quality Wholesale Merchandise" could also use a different 
font or something.  
~~~~

This is a let's get down to business website.  Everything is 
carefully explained and simple to understand.  Definitely 
focused and sounds like a great business to be in.  The only 
things I could suggest is to have testimonials from current 
distributors and information about how long you have been 
in business.
~~~~

Great colour and layout consistent throughout the whole site,
with easy to follow text.  My only query was that International
involvement was not addressed.

<p>There was a lot of information there.&nbsp; The links were useful and
<br>worked just fine.&nbsp; I felt the only way to understand what was
<br>happening would be to print off information and read it ON
<br>PAPER OFFLINE.
<br>~~~~
<p>At first glance this is an extremely well designed site.
<br>Navigation is easy, color choices are great and no blatant errors.
<p>However after spending over 10 minutes going through the site
<br>for several pages and checking the Questions and Answers page
<br>and finally going to the order page before I could find out the
<br>cost and possibly order the " sales kit ".
<p>I find that the offer is not for anyone except US citizens - therefore
<br>eliminating and alienating over 1/2 the internet .. ( Yes the US is
<br>important but the internet is a WORLD WIDE web - about 55%
<br>are not American. IF the product is not available anywhere else
<br>except in the US at this time.&nbsp; State that&nbsp; on your opening
page.
<br>You may expand your market later to involve the majority of
<br>Internet users who are Not living in the USA and might mention
<br>that. The way it reads now you have P'd off anyone that had an
<br>interest in your proposition and went to the trouble of going
<br>through your presentation only to find that they can't order it.
<br>~~~~
<p>Overall design plan is good in navigation and viewing, but it
<br>is lacking in pictures.&nbsp; Although graphics can slow a page
<br>down some, it makes the reader want to read.&nbsp;&nbsp; So add some
<br>well placed graphics and maybe some pullquotes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title
<br>"Quality Wholesale Merchandise" could also use a different
<br>font or something.
<br>~~~~
<p>This is a let's get down to business website.&nbsp; Everything is
<br>carefully explained and simple to understand.&nbsp; Definitely
<br>focused and sounds like a great business to be in.&nbsp; The only
<br>things I could suggest is to have testimonials from current
<br>distributors and information about how long you have been
<br>in business.
<br>~~~~
<p>Great colour and layout consistent throughout the whole site,
<br>with easy to follow text.&nbsp; My only query was that International
<br>involvement was not addressed.
