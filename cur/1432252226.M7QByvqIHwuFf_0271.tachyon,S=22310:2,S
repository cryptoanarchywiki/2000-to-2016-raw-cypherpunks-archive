AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report.

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program
(USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the
woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet.
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the
bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.


"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old
woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my
husband earns in a year".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he
worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect
that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in
the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of
"Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the
top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the
top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars
in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had
1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow
slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.

I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to
the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."The money
just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike to
several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties,
fifties and hundreds.

"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell
the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really
strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my
dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down
the street (laughs)."

Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting
news team examined and
investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found
that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was completely legal
according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or
Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or
service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal
because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar
fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN
USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: 


'People Are Making Over Half Million Dollars Every 4 to 5 Months 
>From Your Home For An Investment Of Only $25 U.S. Dollars 
Expense One Time'





Before you say ''''Bull'''', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. 

Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New 
Jersey. 

=====================================================================

Here is another testimonial: ''This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and well ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first,

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: 

================== Order all 5 reports shown on the list below=================

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. 

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. 

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will lose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has beentested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 

2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 

3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 

4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 

5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 



PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=====================================================================

Now, take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. 

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 




METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
============================================ 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we 
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people 
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of 
those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people 
responded and ordered Report # 2. 

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million 
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. 

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). 

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... 
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 



NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE 
IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 

============================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 

METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
================================================= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of 
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must 
do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same 
day service on all orders. 

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receive the report. 




====================== AVAILABLE REPORTS====================


ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those 
sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$ 

Follow these guidelines to Guarantee Your Success: 

* If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, 
continue sending e-mails until you do. 

* After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should 
receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 

* Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, 
because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to 
roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down 
on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. 




You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!!




THE FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 

You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for 
the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can 
make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever 
imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any 
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of 
this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 
and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people 
you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be 
on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more 
potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially 
independent. 

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! 

==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS====================== 

'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When 
I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I 
made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn''t work. Jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
===================================================================== 
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind 
to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the 
initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't 
get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I 
found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 
in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not 
matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a 
faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
===================================================================== 
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if 
I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get 
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money 
came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
===================================================================== 
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 
10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $ 20,560.00 and 
by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is 
beautiful, Thanx to internet''.
