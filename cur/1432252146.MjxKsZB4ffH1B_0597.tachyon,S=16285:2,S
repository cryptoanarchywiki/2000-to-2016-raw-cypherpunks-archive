                            shuffling in the pews

         Think you had a bad week? Well, you did. You just didn't
         hear about it. First up: after extraordinary scenes in the
         House of Lords on Wednesday, the government managed to push
         through its five standing orders of the apocalypse - to let
         a smorgasbord of local authorities monitor email and phone
         traffic, plus proposals to force ISPs to retain traffic
         data. All the proposals have been watered down a little
         since they were first aired. But it's all still pretty bad,
         as was indicated by the Tories' desperate attempt to
         introduce a "fatal amendment". Fatal amendments - which
         basically add "This house believes the following law should
         be taken outside and shot:" - are the Nuke-From-Orbit of the
         Lords' arsenal. They haven't been successfully used in the
         House for thirty years. Taken aback by this approach, the
         government went on the offensive, threatening to use
         similiar tactics on future Tory administrations. It all got
         a bit nastily party-political from there on in. When the
         mist cleared, the Lib-Dems had caved on data retention, the
         Tories went off muttering about doing some angry squeaking
         in the Commons, and we got a fistful of bad law. Worse: you
         didn't know any of it was happening until it was far too late.
         http://qwer.org/idcards.html
                  - (from Hansard) LORD RICHARD: You're doing *what*?
         http://www.stand.org.uk/
                              - "not just bad, but maybe illegal too"

         The ID cards roadshow that Blunkett launched this week had a
         little more warning: and perhaps their longer timetable (due
         in 2013) will allow them to be stopped. Especially if the
         government keep on getting over-excited about the biometric
         bits. The reason we need new cards is because of this
         exciting new technology, goes the current spin. Exciting new
         technology, such as retinal scans, which haven't been proven
         to work with large populations, and are *just* like
         passwords, only you can't change them when they're
         compromised, and with a long history of false negatives.
         Particularly impressive is Fiona McTaggart's current pitch.
         An ex-chairwoman for Liberty and now a Minister in the
         government, she attributes her entire volte-face on ID cards
         down to the marvels of biometric magic. "If I'm honest, one
         unstated reason why I have opposed ID cards is my fear that
         this is another thing for me to lose", she gushes, before
         explaining that, because she can't lose her eyes or
         fingerprints, these new ID cards must be okay. We have to
         say: if the government's so excited about new tech, why did
         the ID card consultation still mistake thousands of
         responses from the STAND relay as being automated responses
         from "an organised opposition campaign"?
