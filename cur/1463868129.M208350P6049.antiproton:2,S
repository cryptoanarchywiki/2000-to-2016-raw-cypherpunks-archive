Nice polemic. With deep respect for both titans of history, economics and
metaphysics, lipsmacked with earnest opinion, I 
beg m'lords, for tiny eye-time,
a screenshot of a tangible, physical shard of evidence to substantiate learned
alleged long ago imaginary happenings. Say, a gnawed ankle, a dirt-packed
bowel, a petrified turd, a skull showing insertion of tiger-tooth fact and
sucked dry of bloody ideological superiority.

This is stanky cypherpunks, not a Mar a Lago butler SM account.
