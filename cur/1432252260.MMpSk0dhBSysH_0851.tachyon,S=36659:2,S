Answer :    To eliminate the right click function from Internet 
Explorer, Netscape, and Netscape 6.0, paste this simple JavaScript 
into your BODY tag on your page; 

<script language=JavaScript> 
<!-- 

//Disable right mouse click Script 
//By wORLDwIDEwEBProductions.com 
//Change the var message script as you would like it to read 

var message="Function Disabled!"; 
/////////////////////////////////// 
function clickIE() {if (document.all) {alert(message);return false;}} 
function clickNS(e) {if 
(document.layers||(document.getElementById&&!document.all)) { 
if (e.which==2||e.which==3) {alert(message);return false;}}} 
if (document.layers) 
{document.captureEvents(Event.MOUSEDOWN);document.onmousedown=clickNS;} 
else{document.onmouseup=clickNS;document.oncontextmenu=clickIE;} 
// --> 
</script>

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #136:  http://www.edollars.homestead.com
N Venugopal Rao

Not a bad site, it loaded reasonably quickly, and got to the 
point right away.   Although the background was dark, the 
text was easy to read.   The site wants you to sign up for 
multiple paid to read email programs and predicts that you 
can earn $10,000 a month if you market it properly.  

However, it does not offer to replicate the site for you, which 
means that it could be very hard to achieve that income, as 
you would have to recruit mainly from friends and family, or 
build your own page.   This is perhaps the biggest drawback 
of the site, at least as far as I am concerned.  If there were a 
way to replicate it, so the new sign up could get credit for 
referrals, I think it would work better.
~~~~

Great information on making money with free programs. Good 
copy on how it all works. Would like a breakdown of which 
companies paid the most to get that $10,000 a month.
~~~~

On the edollars site, the content was good, but the layout and 
design needs some work.  Try using a header size font for the 
important stuff, like a header "How does this work?" and putting 
the explanations in a smaller font. Use the same color font for 
all headers, and one different color for all the text.  Put the links 
to the programs on a different page, but link to it both from 
your side column menu and at the bottom of the home page 
after telling how it works.

The banners at the bottom of the home page overlap, so you 
may want to also create a link page, and trade links with other 
people and also but banners for recommended programs there.

When you have a mailing list subscribe form, it is best to put 
a link to this on your home page, and put information about 
what you cover in your mailings (why they should subscribe 
& benefits), the subscribe form, and a privacy policy all on the 
same page so the information is all there in one place. 
~~~~

Although the words stand out well on the black background, it 
is very hard on the eyes to read in this format.  The length of the 
copy makes it even harder. 

The update script you use put the "this page was updated
'today's date'" language under the get paid to click link at the 
bottom.  It also showed up twice in small black print behind some 
of the wording in the bottom of your fourth paragraph. 

The readclick.com link on #48 is missing.  You forgot to put in the 
link...but the words readclick.com are there.  This means people 
can copy and paste the link, but it won't be to your referral page 
and you won't get paid. 

Your banners at the bottom are jumbled and overlapping.  The 
bottom right ad, the really big one in the frame, needs to be scrolled 
to be read.  No one will read it. After you write your ad copy, use 
spell check and grammar check.  It is possible to spell words 
correctly that are used incorrectly and spell check will not catch it. 
~~~~

I don't care for the black background, but that's personal preference.
I didn't find any contact information, and saw some spelling errors 
so I wasn't impressed with the site. I think it is just too much 
information to scroll thru.
~~~~

This is one really long home page.  I would recommend breaking 
up the information, maybe list the pay for email programs on a 
separate page. Also, by using a smaller font, and sticking to one 
or two colors it wouldn't appear like the visitor had to conquer 
Mt. Everest - a mountain of information to read through everything. 
It looks like you have a left column menu set up, but the button 
links are blank. Use those to separate the information.

Separate the paid to read email programs from the other programs.
Go through the home page and check for typos. I saw lots of them 
and they are even more noticable in the large font. For example, 
under #3 "Sign up for free newsletters a paid..." should be "Sign 
up for free newsletters and get paid..."
under #4 "Get paid $2 to signp" should be "Get paid $2 to sign up"

Some of your numbered programs are in caps, some using lower 
case.  Try to make these all the same, preferable using lower case.
The page uses a horizontal scroll bar because of placement of 
some of the banners at the bottom of the page. Set your page up 
so the information fits in the screen width.

Good information, very focused, you just need to make it easier 
for people to view your information.

<p>Not a bad site, it loaded reasonably quickly, and got to the point
<br>right away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the background was dark, the text
was
<br>easy to read.&nbsp;&nbsp; The site wants you to sign up for multiple
paid to
<br>read email programs and predicts that you can earn $10,000 a month
<br>if you market it properly.
<p>However, it does not offer to replicate the site for you, which means
<br>that it could be very hard to achieve that income, as you would have
<br>to recruit mainly from friends and family, or build your own page.
<br>This is perhaps the biggest drawback of the site, at least as far as
<br>I am concerned.&nbsp; If there were a way to replicate it, so the new
sign
<br>up could get credit for referrals, I think it would work better.
<br>~~~~
<p>Great information on making money with free programs. Good
<br>copy on how it all works. Would like a breakdown of which
<br>companies paid the most to get that $10,000 a month.
<br>~~~~
<p>On the edollars site, the content was good, but the layout and
<br>design needs some work.&nbsp; Try using a header size font for the
<br>important stuff, like a header "How does this work?" and putting
<br>the explanations in a smaller font. Use the same color font for all
<br>headers, and one different color for all the text.&nbsp; Put the links
to the
<br>programs on a different page, but link to it both from your side
<br>column menu and at the bottom of the home page after telling how
<br>it works.
<p>The banners at the bottom of the home page overlap, so you may
<br>want to also create a link page, and trade links with other people
<br>and also but banners for recommended programs there.
<p>When you have a mailing list subscribe form, it is best to put a link
<br>to this on your home page, and put information about what you
<br>cover in your mailings (why they should subscribe &amp; benefits),
the
<br>subscribe form, and a privacy policy all on the same page so the
<br>information is all there in one place.
<br>~~~~
<p>Although the words stand out well on the black background, it is
<br>very hard on the eyes to read in this format.&nbsp; The length of the
copy
<br>makes it even harder.
<p>The update script you use put the "this page was updated 'today's
<br>date'" language under the get paid to click link at the bottom.&nbsp;
It
<br>also showed up twice in small black print behind some of the wording
<br>in the bottom of your fourth paragraph.
<p>The readclick.com link on #48 is missing.&nbsp; You forgot to put in
the
<br>link...but the words readclick.com are there.&nbsp; This means people
can
<br>copy and paste the link, but it won't be to your referral page and
you
<br>won't get paid.
<p>Your banners at the bottom are jumbled and overlapping.&nbsp; The bottom
<br>right ad, the really big one in the frame, needs to be scrolled to
be read.
<br>No one will read it. After you write your ad copy, use spell check
and
<br>grammar check.&nbsp; It is possible to spell words correctly that are
used
<br>incorrectly and spell check will not catch it.
<br>~~~~
<p>I don't care for the black background, but that's personal preference.
<br>I didn't find any contact information, and saw some spelling errors
so
<br>I wasn't impressed with the site. I think it is just too much information
<br>to scroll thru.
<br>~~~~
<p>This is one really long home page.&nbsp; I would recommend breaking
up
<br>the information, maybe list the pay for email programs on a separate
<br>page. Also, by using a smaller font, and sticking to one or two colors
<br>it wouldn't appear like the visitor had to conquer Mt. Everest - a
<br>mountain of information to read through everything. It looks like you
<br>have a left column menu set up, but the button links are blank. Use
<br>those to separate the information.
<p>Separate the paid to read email programs from the other programs.
<br>Go through the home page and check for typos. I saw lots of them
<br>and they are even more noticable in the large font. For example,
<br>under #3 "Sign up for free newsletters a paid..." should be "Sign up
<br>for free newsletters and get paid..."
<br>under #4 "Get paid $2 to signp" should be "Get paid $2 to sign up"
<p>Some of your numbered programs are in caps, some using lower
<br>case.&nbsp; Try to make these all the same, preferable using lower
case.
<br>The page uses a horizontal scroll bar because of placement of some
<br>of the banners at the bottom of the page. Set your page up so the
<br>information fits in the screen width.
<p>Good information, very focused, you just need to make it easier
<br>for people to view your information.
