<p>SITE REVIEWED
<p>Comments on Site #125: <a href="http://www.wedeliverparties.com">http://www.wedeliverparties.com</a>
<br>Dawn Clemons
<br>dclemons7@home.com
<br>~~~~
<p>The site looks nice and professional. I really like the
<br>nav bar, it is helpful. The "What's Hot" page needs work.
<br>It is all jumbled together. Some cell spacing, or cell
<br>padding in a table will fix it all up.
<br>~~~~
<p>I have no doubt that there are those who will use the
<br>services of this website, but my question is, why, unless
<br>you live in a remote area? Most of the things they list
<br>can be obtained readily at such places as Wal-Mart, Paper
<br>Warehouse, etc etc, and you see 'em when you buy 'em -
<br>you don't have to wait to have things shipped to you.
<br>Also, the triple-window effect is distracting.
<p>~~~~
<p>I find the color scheme not always very well chosen: it is
<br>not easy to read white text on yellow background.
<p>I would prefer to see more of the main page. The left border
<br>is OK (a little smaller would be better), but the top border
<br>takes up too much space (almost 1/2 of my screen, I use 800x600).
<p>I suppose there is an error in the border of Party Planning,
<br>the summing up makes no sense to me. Also when choosing the
<br>FamilyPages, the contents of the border changes instead of
<br>the main page.
<p>The site is quite easy to navigate, there is (almost always)
<br>a "Back to Main Page" button present. Personally I would
<br>aim to have all sub-menus look the same (font, fontsize,
<br>line spacing,..).
<p>The site has a good "look", but I think it needs some more
<br>checking for minor errors or broken links. I find consistency
<br>in look and structure very important. In choosing some of
<br>their product lines, once you get a new popup window with
<br>a whole different look, at other times the (small)main page
<br>gives you the information. Better go for one option and
<br>apply this to all similar pages.
<p>As my last remark, I personally like the color schemes of
<br>the products pages better. The colors are much brighter.
<br>These pages look more inviting and get you in the mood
<br>for a party !

<p>THANKS FOR REVIEW!

<br>Subject: Thanks for the helpful input
<p>I just wanted to thank those who have visited my site and
<br>took the time to review. All their comments were very helpful.
<p>I changed the margins on my front page and I realized my index
<br>needed some direction. Oh I did get rid of the second welcome.
<br>Thanks for the suggestion. I also added how to get rid of the
<br>pop-ups while searching my site. And I hope to be getting a
<br>domain for my site soon.
<p>Again, Thank You for all the helpful suggestions. This is my
<br>first experience creating a site and your comments have helped
<br>me make it better. You really don't know how helpful this has
<br>been. What a great experience!

<p>SITE REVIEWED
<p>Comments on Site #125: <a href="http://www.wedeliverparties.com">http://www.wedeliverparties.com</a>

<br>~~~~
<p>The site looks nice and professional. I really like the
<br>nav bar, it is helpful. The "What's Hot" page needs work.
<br>It is all jumbled together. Some cell spacing, or cell
<br>padding in a table will fix it all up.
<br>~~~~
<p>I have no doubt that there are those who will use the
<br>services of this website, but my question is, why, unless
<br>you live in a remote area? Most of the things they list
<br>can be obtained readily at such places as Wal-Mart, Paper
<br>Warehouse, etc etc, and you see 'em when you buy 'em -
<br>you don't have to wait to have things shipped to you.
<br>Also, the triple-window effect is distracting.
<p>~~~~
<p>I find the color scheme not always very well chosen: it is
<br>not easy to read white text on yellow background.
<p>I would prefer to see more of the main page. The left border
<br>is OK (a little smaller would be better), but the top border
<br>takes up too much space (almost 1/2 of my screen, I use 800x600).
<p>I suppose there is an error in the border of Party Planning,
<br>the summing up makes no sense to me. Also when choosing the
<br>FamilyPages, the contents of the border changes instead of
<br>the main page.
<p>The site is quite easy to navigate, there is (almost always)
<br>a "Back to Main Page" button present. Personally I would
<br>aim to have all sub-menus look the same (font, fontsize,
<br>line spacing,..).
<p>The site has a good "look", but I think it needs some more
<br>checking for minor errors or broken links. I find consistency
<br>in look and structure very important. In choosing some of
<br>their product lines, once you get a new popup window with
<br>a whole different look, at other times the (small)main page
<br>gives you the information. Better go for one option and
<br>apply this to all similar pages.
<p>As my last remark, I personally like the color schemes of
<br>the products pages better. The colors are much brighter.
<br>These pages look more inviting and get you in the mood
<br>for a party !

<p>THANKS FOR REVIEW!
<p>From: Shirley Turetsky&nbsp; - interactiveopinions@email.com
<br>Subject: Thanks for the helpful input
<p>I just wanted to thank those who have visited my site and
<br>took the time to review. All their comments were very helpful.
<p>I changed the margins on my front page and I realized my index
<br>needed some direction. Oh I did get rid of the second welcome.
<br>Thanks for the suggestion. I also added how to get rid of the
<br>pop-ups while searching my site. And I hope to be getting a
<br>domain for my site soon.
<p>Again, Thank You for all the helpful suggestions. This is my
<br>first experience creating a site and your comments have helped
<br>me make it better. You really don't know how helpful this has
<br>been. What a great experience!
