Subject: US doesn't have the right to decide PoW status

This article adds to the discussion that the Taliban are PoWs.

   Once in front of a court or tribunal, the Pentagon might argue that
   the Taliban were not the government of Afghanistan and that their
   armed forces were not the armed forces of a party to the convention.
   The problem here is that the convention is widely regarded as an
   accurate statement of customary international law, unwritten rules
   binding on all. Even if the Taliban were not formally a party to the
   convention, both they and the US would still have to comply.

   US doesn't have the right to decide who is or isn't a PoW

   Ignore the Geneva convention and we put our own citizens in peril

   Michael Byers

   Would you want your life to be in the hands of US secretary of defence
   Donald Rumsfeld? Hundreds of captured Taliban and al-Qaida fighters
   don't have a choice. Chained, manacled, hooded, even sedated, their
   beards shorn off against their will, they are being flown around the
   world to Guantanamo Bay, a century-old military outpost seized during
   the Spanish-American war and subsequently leased from Cuba by the US.
   There, they are being kept in tiny chain-link outdoor cages, without
   mosquito repellent, where (their captors assure us) they are likely to
   be rained upon.

   Since Guantanamo Bay is technically foreign territory, the detainees
   have no rights under the US constitution and cannot appeal to US
   federal courts. Any rights they might have under international law
   have been firmly denied. According to Rumsfeld, the detainees "will be
   handled not as prisoners of war, because they are not, but as unlawful
   combatants".

   This unilateral determination of the detainees' status is highly
   convenient, since the 1949 Geneva convention on the treatment of
   prisoners of war stipulates that PoWs can only be tried by "the same
   courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of
   the armed forces of the detaining power". The Pentagon clearly intends
   to prosecute at least some of the detainees in special military
   commissions having looser rules of evidence and a lower burden of
   proof than regular military or civilian courts. This will help to
   protect classified information, but also substantially increase the
   likelihood of convictions. The rules of evidence and procedure for the
   military commissions will be issued later this month by none other
   than Donald Rumsfeld.

   The Geneva convention also makes it clear that it isn't for Rumsfeld
   to decide whether the detainees are ordinary criminal suspects rather
   than PoWs. Anyone detained in the course of an armed conflict is
   presumed to be a PoW until a competent court or tribunal determines
   otherwise. The record shows that those who negotiated the convention
   were intent on making it impossible for the determination to be made
   by any single person.

   Once in front of a court or tribunal, the Pentagon might argue that
   the Taliban were not the government of Afghanistan and that their
   armed forces were not the armed forces of a party to the convention.
   The problem here is that the convention is widely regarded as an
   accurate statement of customary international law, unwritten rules
   binding on all. Even if the Taliban were not formally a party to the
   convention, both they and the US would still have to comply.

   The Pentagon might also argue that al-Qaida members were not part of
   the Taliban's regular armed forces. Traditionally, irregulars could
   only benefit from PoW status if they wore identifiable insignia, which
   al-Qaida members seem not to have done. But the removal of the Taliban
   regime was justified on the basis that al-Qaida and the Taliban were
   inextricably linked, a justification that weakens the claim that the
   former are irregulars.

   Moreover, the convention has to be interpreted in the context of
   modern international conflicts, which share many of the aspects of
   civil wars and tend not to involve professional soldiers on both
   sides. Since the convention is designed to protect persons, not
   states, the guiding principle has to be the furtherance of that
   protection. This principle is manifest in the presumption that every
   detainee is a PoW until a competent court or tribunal determines
   otherwise.

   This too is the position of the International Committee of the Red
   Cross, which plays a supervisory role over the convention. The Red
   Cross and Amnesty International have both expressed concerns over the
   treatment of the detainees.

   The authorities at Guantanamo Bay have prohibited journalists from
   filming the arrival of the detainees on the basis that the convention
   stipulates PoWs "must at all times be protected against insults and
   public curiosity". The hypocrisy undermines the position on PoW
   status: you can't have your cake and eat it.

   Even if the detainees were not PoWs, they remain human beings with
   human rights. Hooding, even temporarily, constitutes a violation of
   the 1984 convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading
   treatment. Apart from causing unnecessary mental anguish, it prevents
   a detainee from identifying anyone causing them harm. Forcefully
   shaving off their beards constitutes a violation of the right to human
   dignity under the 1966 international covenant on civil and political
   rights. Forcefully sedating even one detainee for non-medical reasons
   violates international law. Although strict security arrangements are
   important in dealing with potentially dangerous individuals, none of
   these measures are necessary to achieving that goal. If human rights
   are worth anything, they have to apply when governments are most
   tempted to violate them.

   There are many reasons why these and other violations are
   unacceptable. The rights of the detainees are our rights as well. Yet
   international law can be modified as a result of state behaviour. If
   we stand by while the rights of the detainees are undermined, we, as
   individuals, could lose.

   British and American soldiers and aid workers operate around the world
   in conflict zones dominated by quasi-irregular forces. The violations
   in Guantanamo Bay will undermine the ability of our governments to
   ensure adequate treatment the next time our fellow citizens are
   captured and held. Respecting the presumption of PoW status and
   upholding the human rights of detainees today will help to protect our
   people in future.

   The US has occupied much of the moral high ground since September 11,
   and benefited enormously from so doing. Widespread sympathy for the US
   has made it much easier to freeze financial assets and secure the
   detention of suspects overseas, as well as secure intelligence sharing
   and military support. The sympathy has also bolstered efforts to win
   the hearts and minds of ordinary people in the Middle East, south Asia
   and elsewhere. That might just have prevented further terrorist
   attacks.

   Ignoring even some of the rights of those detained in Guantanamo Bay
   squanders this intangible but invaluable asset, in return for nothing
   but the fleeting satisfaction of early revenge. The detainees should
   be accorded full treatment as PoWs and, if not released in due course,
   tried before regular military or civilian courts - or even better, an
   ad hoc international tribunal. As the world watches, vengeance is
   ours. But so, too, are civilised standards of treatment and justice.
