Secure multiparty Bitcoin anonymization by Edward Z. Yang

Abstract. We describe how secure multi-party sorting can serve as the basis
for a Bitcoin anonymization protocol which improves over current centralized
bmixingb designs.

Bitcoin is a pseudonymous protocol: while Bitcoin addresses are in principle
completely anonymous, all traffic into and out of a wallet is publicly
visible. With some simple network analysis collections of addresses can be
linked together and identified.

The current state of the art for anonymizing Bitcoins is a mixing service,
which is trusted third-party wallet which accepts incoming transactions, and
in random increments scheduled at random times in the future, transfers a
corresponding quantity to a new wallet of your choice. The result is given
any Bitcoin that is distributed from this service, there exist a large number
of identities from whom the Bitcoin may have originated.

Mixing services of this kind have a number of notable problems. First, the
mixing service must be trusted not to keep logs or otherwise monitor the
mixing: if they are compromised, the path of any given Bitcoin can be fully
traced. The usual advice for this scenario is to use multiple mixing
services, so that all of these services must be compromised before anonymity
is lost. Second, the mixing service must be trusted not to turn around and
refuse to give you back your funds; this makes such mixing services risky for
anonymizing large quantities of Bitcoins. Finally, most mixing services
charge a processing fee on top of the usual transaction fee one might expect
to pay out for arranging for a Bitcoin transfer.

We propose a decentralized, secure multiparty protocol for implementing a
mixing protocol. Such a system has been proposed in abstract (also here); in
this post, we describe precisely how to implement it, in particular showing
that multi-party sorting (a relatively well-studied algorithmic problem) is
sufficient to implement this protocol. This protocol does not require a
trusted third party (except to assist in discovery of participants interested
in performing the mixing protocol), does not require you to reveal your
input-output addresses beyond the ultimate transaction, and can be performed
atomically using Bitcoinbs transaction language.

Protocol description

First some preliminaries: the multi-party sorting problem is usually
formulated as follows: each party i contributes an input element A[i]. After
the protocol is carried out, all parties learn the sorted sequence A in
secret shared form, but do not learn who contributed any particular element
A[i] of the sequence. Referring to the work of JC3nsson, Kreitz and Uddin
(2011), we assume this protocol as a primitive: the essential idea behind any
multi-party sorting is to construct a fixed size sorting circuit for the
inputs, and then use the general framework of multi-party computation on the
resulting circuit description.

We now describe the mixing problem. Assume that some number of parties are
assembled to mix 1 BTC of coins among themselves. (For now, we assume that
every participant has the same number of Bitcoins; we will generalize this
later.) In particular, each party i has a input wallet A[i] (with balance of
at least 1 BTC) and an output wallet B[i], and will only sign a transaction
in which 1 BTC is transferred to its output wallet B[i]. Any adversary
participating in this transaction should not be able to learn the B[i]
corresponding to A[i], except that it is among the set of output wallets
taking part in the transaction.

The protocol proceeds as follows:

    Every participant declares the input wallet it will be participating in
the protocol with, and produces a signature to show that they own the wallet.
These wallets are publically sorted into A.

    With ordering defined as the numeric value of the public key of each
participating output wallet, conduct a secure multi-party sort of all of the
output wallets. We now have a sorted list of output wallets B, with no member
of the transaction having learned who contributed any given output wallet.
Each participant should check if their output wallet is contained in this
list (to protect against Byzantine failure); if it is not, they should abort
the protocol and destroy their output wallet (its identity has been leaked).

    Construct a transaction transferring 1 BTC from A[0] to B[0] (from the
sorted lists), A[1] to B[1], and so forth and broadcast it to all
participants. Clients sign the transaction with their input wallet.

    Once all signatures have arrived, the transaction is valid and is
broadcast for incorporation into the block chain.

Mixing pools only work if all participants are attempting to mix identical
amounts of Bitcoins. In order to manage participants who would like to mix
larger amounts of Bitcoins, we suggest maintaining discovery channels for
power of two sizes of Bitcoins, e.g. ...1/4 BTC, 1/2 BTC, 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 4
BTC...

Analysis

Step (1) does not mention output wallets, and thus cannot leak information
about the input-output correspondence. By definition, step (2) does not leak
information about who contributed the output wallet. Furthermore, we donbt
even require the sorted result to be secret shared: this sorted list will
become public information once the transaction is published in the block
chain. The case of aborting the transaction when your output wallet is not
present in the result (in the case of Byzantine failure) is delicate:
aborting does leak information, and thus you must not use the output wallet
in any further transactions. In step (3), assuming that an attacker knows
that a mixing transaction is taking place, the deterministic mapping of input
to output wallets gives all participants no further bits of information.
Thus, this protocol clearly fulfills its security requirements.

One odd thing about this protocol is that no random permutation between
participants is explicitly constructed. This might seem unusual, since a
natural security property one might expect is for an output wallet to receive
its 1 BTC from a uniformly randomly chosen input wallet. However, this
condition, while sufficient for anonymity, is not necessary. Just as adding a
random permutation destroys all information about the original permutation,
replacing the original permutation with a new constant permutation also
destroys all information about the original permutation. Furthermore, honest
participants will have picked their addresses uniformly at random, so the
process of sorting automatically constructs a random permutation between
these participants (dishonest participants must be excluded, since they can
generate addresses from a skewed probability distributions).

What is the amount of anonymity granted by one round of this protocol?
Consider the case where I have 1 BTC in an input wallet tied to my identity,
and I participate in a mixing round with n honest participants with a fresh
output wallet. Since no information about the source of this output wallet
was leaked to the participants, an adversary in the transaction would have a
1/n-1 probability of guessing which output wallet was mine: call this the
anonymity factor. In the case of a Sybil attack, the amount of anonymity
conferred decreases. If the fraction of attackers is less than some fraction
of the participants (for many secret sharing protocols, the magic numbers are
1/2 for passive attackers, and 1/3 for active attackers), then the anonymity
factor is still 1/n-1, where n is the number of honest participants; but n is
smaller than the number of visible participants in the protocol: the size of
the transaction is not necessarily correlated with how anonymous it is! If
the number of attackers is above this fraction, then the secret sharing
scheme may leak information and no anonymity is gained. This allows for a
denial of service attack against a mixing protocol; we describe some
mitigation strategies against this attack later. (Note, however, that no
matter how many attackers there are, you are guaranteed to not lose any
Bitcoins, due to the verification step in (2).) In practice

As with traditional mixing, a number of precautions should be taken in order
to avoid accidentally revealing information about the source of Bitcoins via
a side-channel. Consider the case where Alice has 2 BTC tied to her
real-world identity, and she would like to anonymously pay 3/4 BTC to Bob.

Alice first prepare by creating a pool of empty wallets, which she will use
to carry the anonymized Bitcoins. Alice connects to a tracker for 1 BTC
mixing over Tor. (1 BTC is the amount she would like to pay to Bob, rounded
up.) She waits a time window to expire for the next mixing, and then as the
protocol takes place submits her (public) input wallet and her (anonymous)
output wallet. If the protocol fails, she throws out her output wallet and
submits a new one next time, and blacklists the misbehaving node if she can
figure out who it is.

Once Alice has successfully carried out a mixing, she flips a coin (which
comes up heads with probability 1/m). If the coin comes up heads, she waits
for another mixing. The number of mixing transactions she is expected to
perform is m (obeying the geometric distribution, so selected because it
makes all output wallets behave identically with regards to remixing or
exiting). Once Alice exits mixing, she now has a wallet containing an
anonymous Bitcoin (more precisely, this Bitcoin could be attributable with
equal probability to any of the other wallets that she participated in mixes
with). She transfers 3/4 BTC to Bob, leaving 1/4 BTC in her wallet.

The remaining Bitcoins in the wallet should now be considered tainted (as
they now have a direct relationship to Bob, who may have a public wallet).
These Bitcoins should be split into mixable amounts and reanonymized, before
used for any other purposes. Even after anonymization, these coins must still
be used with care: in particular, they must not be transferred back to the
original, public Bitcoin account. In such a situation, the graph structure of
mixing transactions looks like this:

/img/bitcoin-mixer.png

(The green node is your public node, the red node is your anonymous node).
Network analysis that looks for cycles in Bitcoin transfers will be able to
identify any transactions, even if the anonymizing pool has a large amount of
turnover (though, amusingly enough, if many participants generate cycles,
this attack is harder to carry out). To assist in the tracking of these
coins, we suggest the development of wallet management software that can
handle thousands of private keys, sort by bsize of coinb, and track the
easily traceable transaction history associated with any given coin.

In order to protect herself against Sybil attacks, Alice may wish to select
her mixing tracker with care. Some mixing trackers could charge fees for
listing: with sufficient volume, these charges would make it more expensive
to carry out a sustained Sybil attack. (The fees can then be turned around
and used to pay for the processing of the complicated mixing transactions,
which have the social expectation of being accompanied with a transaction
fee.) Every mixing should be conducted with a different IP address; if Alice
is using Tor for anonymity she needs to reanonymize her connection each time.
Conclusion

Secure multi-party computation has always been in the eye of users of Bitcoin
seeking anonymization, but to date there has not been any plausible
implementation strategy for any such computation. We hope that this document
describes such an implementation strategy and leads the way to a better
ecosystem of Bitcoin anonymizers. As the fiascos at Bitcoinica and other
exchanges have demonstrated, relying on third party wallets is dangerous.
Fortunately, they are also unnecessary.
