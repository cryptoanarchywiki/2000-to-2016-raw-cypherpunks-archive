Millionaire:<BR><BR>I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - 
follow what it<BR>says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a 
RECESSION is coming <BR>or not,who is President, or whether you keep your 
current job or not. Yes, I know <BR>what you are thinking. I never responded to 
one of these before either. One day<BR>though, something just said "you throw away $25.00&nbsp;for 
many useless products".</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">    &nbsp;"What the heck." 
Believe me, no matter where you believe<BR>"those feelings" come from, I thank 
every day that I had that feeling.<BR>I cannot imagine where I would be or what 
I would be doing had I not. Read<BR>on.&nbsp; It's true. Every word of it. It is 
legal. I checked. Simply because <BR>you are buying and selling something of 
value.<BR><BR>AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:<BR><BR>Making over half million dollars

INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!<BR><BR>Before you say 
''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter<BR>you have been hearing 
about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of <BR>this letter on the 
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted <BR>an entire show to 
the investigation of this program described below, to see if it <BR>really can 
make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the <BR>program was 
legal.<BR><BR>Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
NO<BR>Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 
"follow<BR>the simple instruction" they are bound to make some mega bucks with 
only <BR>$25 out of pocket cost''.<BR>DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY 
&amp; RESPECT THIS<BR>PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY&nbsp;&nbsp; WORKING 
BETTER THAN EVER.<BR><BR>This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this 
profitable opportunity". I<BR>was approached many times before but each time I 
passed on it. I am so glad <BR>I finally joined just to see what one could 
expect in return for the<BR>minimal effort and money required. To my 
astonishment, I received a total $<BR>610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still 
coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort <BR>Lee, New 
Jersey.<BR>==================================================<BR>Another said: 
"this program has been around for a long time but I never<BR>believed in it. But 
one day when I received this again in the mail I<BR>decided to gamble my $25 on 
it. I followed the simple instructions and <BR>walaa ..... 3<BR>weeks later the 
money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 <BR>but<BR>the next 2 
months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the <BR>past 
8<BR>months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am 
<BR>playing<BR>it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the 
simple steps <BR>and NOT change<BR>anything.'' More testimonials later but 
first, =======<BR><BR>==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE 
====<BR>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<BR><BR>If you 
would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily<BR>and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN 
<BR>!!!<BR><BR>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<BR><BR>FOLLOW 
THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS<BR>WILL COME TRUE, 
GUARANTEED!<BR><BR>&nbsp;INSTRUCTIONS:<BR><BR>=====Order all 5 reports shown on 
the list below =====<BR><BR>For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER 
OF THE REPORT YOU<BR>ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears <BR>ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS 
IS ON <BR>YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems.<BR><BR>===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===<BR>===YOU ORDER 
EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===<BR>You will need all 5 reports so that you can save 
them on your computer<BR>and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = 
$25.00.<BR><BR>Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports<BR>from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so 
they will <BR>be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will 
order them <BR>from you.<BR>Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on 
your desk in case <BR>something happens to your computer.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT - DO 
NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to<BR>each report, or 
their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is<BR>instructed below in 
step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on the <BR>majority of your 
profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does 
not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you 
alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put 
their<BR>friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the 
money. <BR>But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be 
greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than 
what is instructed. <BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, 
honesty reaps the reward!!! <BR>This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering 
a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be 
VERY profitable in a short period <BR>of time.<BR><BR>1.. After you have ordered 
all 5 reports, take this advertisement and<BR>REMOVE the name &amp; address of 
the person in REPORT # 5. This person has<BR>made it through the cycle and is no 
doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2..Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 
4 down TO REPORT # 5.<BR><BR>3.. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 3 down 
TO REPORT # 4.<BR><BR>4.. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 2 down TO 
REPORT # 3.<BR><BR>5.. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT 
# 2<BR><BR>6.... Insert YOUR name &amp; address in the REPORT # 1 
Position.<BR><BR>PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name &amp; address ACCURATELY! 
This is<BR>critical to YOUR 
success.<BR><BR>==================================================<BR>**** Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save<BR>it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.<BR><BR>Save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. To assist<BR>you with marketing your business on 
the internet, the 5 reports you<BR>purchase will provide you with invaluable 
marketing information which <BR>includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where 
to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary 
methods to get this venture going:<BR><BR>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR>==================================================<BR><BR>Let's say 
that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we<BR>will assume 
You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.<BR>Let's also assume 
that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) <BR>response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many peoplewill 
send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).<BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR><BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. 
Those 10<BR>people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 
50,000. <BR>Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. 
That's=100 people<BR>responded and ordered Report # 2.<BR><BR>Those 100 people 
mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000<BR>e-mails. The 0.2% response 
to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.<BR><BR>Those 1000 people send 5,000 
e-mail each for a total of 5 million<BR>e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 
10,000 orders for Report # 4.<BR><BR>Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails 
each for a total of 50,000,000<BR>(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to 
that is 100,000 orders for <BR>Report # 5. <BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES 
$5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).<BR><BR>Your total income in this 
example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....<BR>$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... 
$500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00<BR><BR>NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL 
&amp; PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE<BR>WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>==================================================<BR><BR>REMEMBER 
FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if <BR>everyone or half or even one 
4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? <BR>There are over 150 
million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, with <BR>thousands more 
coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!<BR><BR>METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE 
INTERNET<BR>==================================================<BR><BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds<BR>of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will<BR>easily get a larger 
response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 <BR>and add<BR>METHOD #2 
as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is <BR>e-mail them 
the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all 
orders.<BR><BR>This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name 
and<BR>address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until 
they<BR>receive the report.<BR><BR>===========AVAILABLE REPORTS 
====================<BR>The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal 
or somehow<BR>"wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards 
to be <BR>cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE 
there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.<BR><BR>ORDER 
EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. 
CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed 
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER &amp; the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.<BR><BR>PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$<BR><BR>Follow these guidelines to guarantee 
your success:<BR><BR>=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 
within 2<BR>weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.<BR><BR>=== After you 
have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should<BR>receive 100 
orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue<BR>advertising or 
sending e-mails until you do.<BR><BR>**Once you have received 100 or more orders 
for Report # 2, YOU CAN<BR>RELAX, because the system is already working for you, 
and the cash will <BR>continue<BR>to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved<BR>down on the list, you are placed in front of a 
Different report.<BR><BR>You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which 
report people are<BR>ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND 
ANOTHER<BR>BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT 
<BR>to the income you can generate from this business 
!!!<BR>=================================================<BR>FOLLOWING IS A NOTE 
FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have<BR>just received information that

and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money <BR>in the<BR>next few 
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program

.....# 5 as instructed<BR>above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 ormore <BR>e-mails<BR>and your name will be on every one of them.

will reach. So my friend, I have given you<BR>the ideas, information, materials 
and opportunity to become financially<BR>independent.<BR>IT IS UP TO YOU NOW 
!<BR>=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============<BR>'' My name is Mitchell. My 
wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an<BR>accountant with a major U.S. 
Corporation and I make pretty good money.<BR>When I received this program I 
grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk <BR>mail''. I<BR>made fun of the whole 
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved. I 
''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my <BR>supposed<BR>intelligence 
and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made<BR>merciless fun of her, 
and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her <BR>when<BR>the thing 
didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
<BR>received<BR>50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00<BR>......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jodyin her 
''hobby''.<BR>Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, 
Illinois<BR>================================================<BR>'' Not being the 
gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my<BR>mind to participate in 
this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that <BR>the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't <BR>get enough orders 
to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I <BR>found my medium 
size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 i<BR>the first 12 
weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not <BR>matter where 
people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so 
big''.&nbsp; Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada<BR>=================================================<BR>'' I had received 
this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered<BR>if I should have 
given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to<BR>get another copy, 
so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone<BR>else.........11 months 
passed then it luckily came again...... I did not<BR>delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the <BR>money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, 
N.Y.<BR>=================================================<BR>'' It really is a 
great opportunity to make relatively easy money with<BR>little cost to you. I 
followed the simple instructions carefully and<BR>within 10 days the money 
started to come in. My first month I made $ 20, <BR>560.00 and by the end of 
third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to 
internet''. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New
