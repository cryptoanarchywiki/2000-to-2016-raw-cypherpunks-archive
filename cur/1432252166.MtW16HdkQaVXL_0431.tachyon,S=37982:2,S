Subject:  How can I get a response to my advertising?

I have sent out over 15 million ads, using every free ad page on
the net and not got a single answer. Please tell me what's wrong.

They are looking like this:
1  Upgrade you life with SMALLBIZFFA for only 37 dollars
ones!       (then the website address)

2 For only 5 dollars invest, you can now Bulkmail for free
(then the website address)

Hello Steve,

Take heart, you are not alone... sometimes conflicts can arise
due to the programs you have installed on your computer.  I
had the exact same problem with the time displayed on my taskbar.
I was running Windows 98 and Norton AntiVirus 2000.  I
downloaded a fix and I've been cured - this was over a year
ago.  From memory, it was from the Symantec Norton AntiVirus
site (see second URL below).

There are a couple of things you can try:

Windows Clock on Taskbar and in Date/Time Tool Loses Time
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q189/7/06.ASP

System clock loses time when using Norton AntiVirus 2000
(cut & paste the link on one line)
http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nav.nsf/df0a595864594c86852567ac0063608c/
0473528ab04a4365882567fd00760e7c?OpenDocument

I have also come across defrag starting over and over again in
a never-ending cycle with the message:

"Drive's contents changed; restarting..."

ScanDisk and Defrag require that the hard disk not be
accessed while they are running.  Every time the hard disk
is accessed, these programs will be restarted.  To stop the
hard disk being accessed, make sure all programs and
background processes are closed.  You can do this by
accessing the Task Manager (Ctr+Alt+Del) and selecting
each item, then clicking on End Task.   NOTE: Make sure
you let Explorer (in the Task Manager) continue running.
Also disable your screen saver and unplug USB devices.
Then, run ScanDisk and Defrag.  This is for people with
serious ScanDisk and Defrag difficulties.

For me, it was not necessary to take such drastic action.
By disabling screen saver, both processes were completed
without a hitch.

There is a good explanation on the workings of ScanDisk
and Defrag and a step-by-step guide on how to stop going
around in ever decreasing circles!  Go to:
http://windows.about.com/library/weekly/aa071300b.htm

Hope this solves your dilemma, Steve.

Regards,

Bob Bilton

For the answer of ugly links on urls of your advertisers. You
can hide the query string on these urls but not the directory
links.  If you need assistance on getting this done we do cold
fusion consulting for very reasonable prices.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #130:
http://hometown.aol.com/laurigal47/myhomepage/sale.html
LauriGal47@aol.com
~~~~

This site was like a 'favorites' page, so I have suggestions
to improve or add to the site. But, I also could not figure
out the focus of this site, so keep that in mind while
reading my suggestions.

At the top of the page is said "Flame's Hearth II" which
leaves me to assume there is a page "I" - if so, link to it.
There was no introduction, explaining what I would get
out of scrolling down through the site, so in effect, no
reason for me to see more than what I could in the first
screen area.

There was a lot of blank space between the categories,
which makes the page seem longer. And explanations
by the links telling me why those were your favorite
pages, or what links were brand new would have been
helpful.  Maybe date the free sample links.
~~~~

Kind of a neat page of freebies.  Not too cluttered. Liked it.
~~~~

First Impression: BLAND,

Seems obvious that Lauri is very new at this and is using a
cookie cutter web-builder. Well, Lauri I am still pretty green
behind the ears myself and need the cookie cutters, too.

If your web-builder allows you variety in color, fonts, adding
pictures etc, play around and bring excitement into this site.
I am not really sure what you expect the results to be for your
site? Purpose? for example: I have this site to share free stuff
as a means to get visitors so I can then offer other stuff
which I am selling.

If that is the case, instead of  leading with your favorite
sites (which are not all that exciting either), why not do a site
which gets traffic because your main emphasis is on the FREE
stuff?  Or on what ever your site's purpose is.

Your website address is pretty iffy. You could benefit from
a domain name here.

Lauri, I am not putting you down, I congratulate you for
taking the step. That is how we learn. Just play with it, look
for tools, ask others how they do it, etc., and over time you'll
get okay at that. The more sites you review yourself, the
better you will get. Also, consider to find a local kid (they
are so good at that stuff) who can be hired for a few dollars
to help you.  My children did my www.prosperouswomen.com
site, artwork and all. I hope this helps you.
~~~~

I liked the layout of the site - it was easy to read
but it wasn't very inviting.  I think it needs more
colours and perhaps some graphics or even small
promotional banners down the right side.
~~~~

This looks like a first attempt for someone building a web
page, and is missing some basic and necessary information
to be viewed by more than family and friends. If LaurieGal
wants to get traffic to her site she needs to add meta tags
and specific keywords, contact information, and some
wording that shows personality or uniqueness.

The links are good links, and specializing in finding free
products to order off the internet is a good idea, but there
are a million sites that do this. An introduction or personal
comments about each product or link would be helpful
and set this site apart.

The colors are easy to view, the layout clean and easy to
scroll through, but this site doesn't have any personality.
~~~~

Nice simple design, soft colors. To make this site seem
bigger and not just a one page site, maybe create a separate
page for each category, and add a one line description
after each link.

<p>I have also come across defrag starting over and over again in
<br>a never-ending cycle with the message:
<p>"Drive's contents changed; restarting..."
<p>ScanDisk and Defrag require that the hard disk not be
<br>accessed while they are running.&nbsp; Every time the hard disk
<br>is accessed, these programs will be restarted.&nbsp; To stop the
<br>hard disk being accessed, make sure all programs and
<br>background processes are closed.&nbsp; You can do this by
<br>accessing the Task Manager (Ctr+Alt+Del) and selecting
<br>each item, then clicking on End Task.&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Make sure
<br>you let Explorer (in the Task Manager) continue running.
<br>Also disable your screen saver and unplug USB devices.
<br>Then, run ScanDisk and Defrag.&nbsp; This is for people with
<br>serious ScanDisk and Defrag difficulties.
<p>For me, it was not necessary to take such drastic action.
<br>By disabling screen saver, both processes were completed
<br>without a hitch.
<p>There is a good explanation on the workings of ScanDisk
<br>and Defrag and a step-by-step guide on how to stop going
<br>around in ever decreasing circles!&nbsp; Go to:

<br>>browser's address box.&nbsp; I often have links from advertisers
<br>>to this site that are long and ugly.
<p>For the answer of ugly links on urls of your advertisers. You
<br>can hide the query string on these urls but not the directory
<br>links.&nbsp; If you need assistance on getting this done we do cold

<p>This site was like a 'favorites' page, so I have suggestions
<br>to improve or add to the site. But, I also could not figure
<br>out the focus of this site, so keep that in mind while
<br>reading my suggestions.
<p>At the top of the page is said "Flame's Hearth II" which
<br>leaves me to assume there is a page "I" - if so, link to it.
<br>There was no introduction, explaining what I would get
<br>out of scrolling down through the site, so in effect, no
<br>reason for me to see more than what I could in the first
<br>screen area.
<p>There was a lot of blank space between the categories,
<br>which makes the page seem longer. And explanations
<br>by the links telling me why those were your favorite
<br>pages, or what links were brand new would have been
<br>helpful.&nbsp; Maybe date the free sample links.
<br>~~~~
<p>Kind of a neat page of freebies.&nbsp; Not too cluttered. Liked it.
<br>~~~~
<p>First Impression: BLAND,
<p>Seems obvious that Lauri is very new at this and is using a
<br>cookie cutter web-builder. Well, Lauri I am still pretty green
<br>behind the ears myself and need the cookie cutters, too.
<p>If your web-builder allows you variety in color, fonts, adding
<br>pictures etc, play around and bring excitement into this site.
<br>I am not really sure what you expect the results to be for your
<br>site? Purpose? for example: I have this site to share free stuff
<br>as a means to get visitors so I can then offer other stuff
<br>which I am selling.
<p>If that is the case, instead of&nbsp; leading with your favorite
<br>sites (which are not all that exciting either), why not do a site
<br>which gets traffic because your main emphasis is on the FREE
<br>stuff?&nbsp; Or on what ever your site's purpose is.
<p>Your website address is pretty iffy. You could benefit from
<br>a domain name here.
<p>Lauri, I am not putting you down, I congratulate you for
<br>taking the step. That is how we learn. Just play with it, look
<br>for tools, ask others how they do it, etc., and over time you'll
<br>get okay at that. The more sites you review yourself, the
<br>better you will get. Also, consider to find a local kid (they
<br>are so good at that stuff) who can be hired for a few dollars
<br>to help you.&nbsp; My children did my www.prosperouswomen.com
<br>site, artwork and all. I hope this helps you.
<br>~~~~
<p>I liked the layout of the site - it was easy to read
<br>but it wasn't very inviting.&nbsp; I think it needs more
<br>colours and perhaps some graphics or even small
<br>promotional banners down the right side.
<br>~~~~
<p>This looks like a first attempt for someone building a web
<br>page, and is missing some basic and necessary information
<br>to be viewed by more than family and friends. If LaurieGal
<br>wants to get traffic to her site she needs to add meta tags
<br>and specific keywords, contact information, and some
<br>wording that shows personality or uniqueness.
<p>The links are good links, and specializing in finding free
<br>products to order off the internet is a good idea, but there
<br>are a million sites that do this. An introduction or personal
<br>comments about each product or link would be helpful
<br>and set this site apart.
<p>The colors are easy to view, the layout clean and easy to
<br>scroll through, but this site doesn't have any personality.
<br>~~~~
<p>Nice simple design, soft colors. To make this site seem
<br>bigger and not just a one page site, maybe create a separate
<br>page for each category, and add a one line description
<br>after each link.
