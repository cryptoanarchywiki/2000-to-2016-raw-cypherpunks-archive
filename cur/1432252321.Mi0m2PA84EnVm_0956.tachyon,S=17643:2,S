EARN EXTRA MONEY THIS WINTER RIGHT FROM YOUR HOME! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
---------------


I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:
I Actually Read a Piece of E-mail which has helped me become debt 
free   
-----------------------------------------------------------------
---------------

Hello Friend,

As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my 
account primarily for business and personal use. I received what 
I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it 
each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of the 
catchy subject line, I finally read it. Afterwards, I thought , 
"OK, I'll give in, I'm going to try this. I can certainly afford 
to invest $25 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with 
creating a little excess cash." I promptly mailed our $5 bills 
and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small 
fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me. After reading 
the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for 
free!

I was not prepared for the results. Everyday for the last six 
weeks, my P. O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days 
the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to 
the corporate-size box! I am stunned by all the money that keeps 
rolling in!

My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a 
substantial downpayment on a house. Now,  we are purchasing a 
house with a 40% down payment!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be 
prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow 
up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money 
as we did. You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll 
bet you already are. If you can open an envelope, remove the 
money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the 
bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy 
it is. If I can do this, so can you!



      This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON. PRINT this 
letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!
     


You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program 
you may ever see. Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven 
its ability to generate large amounts of cash.

This program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and 
ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity. It does 
not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, 
and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get 
the mail and go to the bank!

This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for! Simply 
follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial 
dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, 
multi-level marketing program works perfectly

 ...100% EVERY TIME!

Thousands of people have used this program to:
- Raise capital to start their own business
- Pay off debts
- Buy homes, cars, etc.,
- Even retire!

This is your chance, so don't pass it up!


-----------------------------------------------------------------
---------------


OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING 
PROGRAM


-----------------------------------------------------------------
---------------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5 US that costs next 
to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level 
businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and 
selling our products. Every state in the U.S. allows you to 
recruit new multi-level business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of five business and 
financial reports costing $5.00 each. Each order you receive via 
"snail mail" (regular mail) will include:
* $5.00US cash
* The name and number of the report they are ordering
* The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the
report they ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.

THAT'S IT!

The $5.00 is yours!

This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business 
anywhere!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE PREPARED TO REAP THE 
STAGGERING BENEFITS!

                           $$$$ IMPORTANT INFORMATION $$$$


****** READ CAREFULLY! *******


-----------------------------------------------------------------
---------------


S E T U P      I N S T R U C T I O N S
*******************************************************

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 5 reports from the different individuals shown on 
the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).

* For each report, send $5 US CASH, the NAME  NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR RETURN 
POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose name 
appears on the list next to the report.

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five 
reports. You will need all five reports so that you can save them 
on your computer and resell them.

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 
five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1, 000's of people who will 
order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are 
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any 
way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or 
you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you 
understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't 
work if you change it.  Remember this method has been tested, and 
if you alter it, it will not work.
a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
b. After you've ordered the five reports, replace the name and 
address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the 
one that was there down to REPORT #2.
c. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
REPORT #3.
d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
REPORT #4.

e. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #4 down to 
REPORT #5.
f. The name and address that was under REPORT #5 is removed from 
the list and has NO DOUBT collected their thousands.

Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address 
ACCURATELY!!! 

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction 
portion of this letter.

4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the 
WORLDWIDE WEB! Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive, 
and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another 
avenue which you could use is to send thousands of emails for 
free, which you will learn how from the reports.

BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them 
the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY 
SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY 
send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt 
because they can't advertise until they receive the report!

------------------------------------------

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it 
works.   Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on 
your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet and 
sending emails will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume 
that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline 
members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results 
below.

1st level--your 10 members with $5..............$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10
.......................($5 x 100).............$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100
.......................($5 x 1,000)...........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000
.......................($5 x 10,000)..........$50,000
5th level—10 members from those 10,000

.......................($5x 100,000)..........$500,000

THIS TOTALS
-----------
$555,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate 
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen 
if they got 20 people to participate!

Most people get 100's of participants!

THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely 
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an internet 
connection and e-mail is FREE!!! 

REPORT#5 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing 
and how easy it is.

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******
* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and 
follow the directions accurately.
* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them 
when the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested 
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal  Lottery Laws, 
Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in 
theU.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 
and 436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged 
for money received."

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two 
weeks, continue advertising and sending until you do. Then, a 
couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for 
REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising and sending until 
you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, 
YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and 
the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in 
front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS 
by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you 
want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and 
start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income 
you will generate from this business!

NOTE: If you need help with starting a business, registering a 
business name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your 
local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal 
agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the 
Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free 
seminars about business taxes.

*******T E S T I M O N I A L S*******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! 
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a 
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a 
great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost 
to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program 
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am 
a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty 
good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about 
receiving "junk mail. "  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting 
my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" 
it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and 
was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing 
didn't work...well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had 
received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over 
$147,200 in $5 bills! 

I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it 
wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her 
"hobby."  I did have seven more years until retirement, but I 
think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to 
MLM. Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to 
you. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come 
in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the 
plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!! Paul Johnson, 
Raleigh, NC

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this 
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to 
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached 
several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see 
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 
14 weeks, with money still coming in.
Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
