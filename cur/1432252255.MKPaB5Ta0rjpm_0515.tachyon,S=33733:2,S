Hi, Richard!  

Can you believe it? Summer is winding down, and Fall is just around 
the corner. With the seasonal change, comes quite a bit of 
rearranging, especially with your wardrobe! It's time to put away 
those shorts and tanks and unpack those sweaters and long pants. 
Whether the beginning of Fall means it's time for you to sweep clean 
your home or search the storage bins for cooler climate clothes - it 
no doubt takes a lot of energy and motivation to prepare your home 
for the long winter months ahead.

Let's get organized!


Mary




P.S.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of the families who were 
affected by our national tragedy.

Do your part to help support America's rescue and relief effort.

CLOTHING CRISIS OF THE MONTH

This month's featured neighbor is Heather from Nashville, Tennessee:

It's always so hard for me to motivate myself to put away my swimsuit 
and sandals. This year I was even more discouraged when I started to 
pull out my Fall clothes and noticed a small spot of mildew on my 
favorite white sweater! Is there hope that I can still save my sweater 
after it has been sitting in storage for months untreated? Please 
help!

Heather, you are not alone, so don't despair! Try these tips to help 
remove hidden stains, and learn how to keep your fabrics safe for 
seasonal storing. 




THIS MONTH'S TIPS

TIP 1

Mildew stains can be quite discouraging, but Tide may help remove 
those stains and help keep your clothes looking like new.

Before treating any garment, always refer to the care label 
instructions. Then, soak the garment for up to 30 minutes in a plastic 
bucket by adding 1/2 dose Tide(R) with Bleach per gallon of water. 
Weight the item with a white towel to keep the garment submerged. 
Discard soaking solution prior to laundering. Next, wash in one dose 
of Tide in warm water. Finally, line or air-dry and repeat the 
procedure if necessary.

http://newsletter.tide.com/cgi-bin3/flo?y=mHZ70Cdgcv0Bet0IC30B5 
for more stain-removal tips!
 


TIP 2
 
We all know the importance of keeping our clothes in the best possible 
condition. Some fabrics are simply too expensive to replace! Proper 
storage techniques will help to maintain the quality of fabrics and 
clothing, and increase their longevity.

Rule 1: Take precaution and always make sure you wash or dry-clean all 
clothes and linens before packing them away into storage. Often times 
clothes may not look dirty on the outside, but some stains don't 
always appear right away. In addition, insects are attracted to soils 
left on clothes, but cleaning them thoroughly will help to reduce this 
attraction.

Rule 2: Make sure all clothing and fabrics are completely dry before 
packing them away into storage. Keep closet storage to a minimum, to 
allow for proper air circulation among your clothes. Make sure you 
keep your closets cool and dry to prevent mildew from affecting your 
clothes.

Finally, try tossing a Bounce(R) 
http://newsletter.tide.com/cgi-bin3/flo?y=mHZ70Cdgcv0Bet0KwC0BG 
fabric softener sheet into the storage bins to add freshness to your 
clothes while in storage.

THIS MONTH IN FABRIC CARE HISTORY

The history of soapmaking dates back to the seventh century where it 
became an established craft in Europe. Italy, Spain and France became 
the primary centers for soap manufacturing because of their vast 
supplies of oil from olive trees. The American colonies began 
commercial soapmaking in 1608, when numerous soapmakers arrived in 
Jamestown, VA. In the early stages, soapmaking was considered a 
household chore, but later soapmaking became a noble profession.

HE Talk 

So, what is an HE washer anyway? These high-efficiency (HE) machines 
are considered the top-of-the-line washers in the industry. Usually, 
HE washers are "front loaders" but top loading machines are beginning 
to appear on the market. The HE machines offer many benefits over 
standard washing machines - they use 50% less water, allow you to wash 
larger loads, help save money on utility bills, and are more gentle on 
your clothes.

To learn more about HE washers, go to: 
Tide HE http://newsletter.tide.com/cgi-bin3/flo?y=mHZ70Cdgcv0Bet0KwB0BF 
and see our featured manufacturer links at the bottom of the page.

                top-of-the-line washers in the industry. Usually, HE washers are "front loaders" but top 
                loading machines are beginning to appear on the market. The HE machines offer many benefits 
                over standard washing machines &#8211; they use 50% less water, allow you to wash larger loads, 
                help save money on utility bills, and are more gentle on your clothes.<br>
