security measures, we regularly screen activity in the PayPal system. We 
recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your account. We requested 
information from you for the following reason: <br>
<br>
We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party. <br>
Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have 
limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may 
be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for 
your protection. <br>

<br>
This is a reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible. <br>
In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will remain 
limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your 
account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in further 
limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in to your 
PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this. <br>
