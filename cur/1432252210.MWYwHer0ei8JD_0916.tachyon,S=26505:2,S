QUESTIONS:

From: Steve Black   - webworker@grapemail.net
Subject:  ScanDisk and Defrag aren't working. What do I do?

Hello,

I am having a problem running maintainence on my computer.  
ScanDisk and Defrag seem to keep running over and over 
without any results. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling them, 
but that did not work.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled 
Windows 98 II.  

Also, my clock kicks back an hour ever once in a while for 
no apparrent reason.  Has anyone else ever ran into these 
problems?  Any suggestions?

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #129: http://www.mlmAnonymous.com

mlmanonymous had a lot of good information but it was 
very overwhelming. The home page seemed to jump around 
between the what's, the who's and answering questions. I 
would recommend dividing this information - have a page 
on why you recommend, overviews of the three products 
on another page, faq's on another page.

The text on some of the pages was very tiny, and would 
be easier to read in a san-sarif font such as arial.

I like the site name, but didn't see the fit between it and 
health products. The feel of the site was on use these 
products for your health, not to make money like so many 
other biz-opp sites, so the name just seemed to conflict 
with the message.
~~~~

The site is clear enough but to tell the truth I got lost in the 
text. I didn't understand most of it and got turned away. It 
seems you're selling through various affiliate programs or home 
businesses on Health Products (a lot of this around). There's 
lots of info here but perhaps too much. A good summary on 
the 1st page would do wonders.
~~~~

I had to get out my dictionary for a couple of the words in 
your first paragraph, and I have a college education. You're 
going to be missing or turning off a lot of people with your 
current wording.

On the other hand, if you would develop the "I had faced 
some serious health challenges..." and tell people your 
story more people would be drawn into your site.

The layout is fine, you're just covering too much on your 
home page, and switching topics too often.
~~~~

This site did not load fully in my screen but overlapped.
I'm not sure what makes sites do that, and very few do,
but it is a little bothersome as I have to scroll over to
see the rest of the page. It also had those annoying pop 
up windows.

I like the products advertised and there is a lot of info on 
them, so that's good.
~~~~

The information on this site should be divided in to two 
different websites.  The focus is divided between health 
products and mlm programs, confusing the reader. 

I would have liked to see more information about what 
the mlm anon meetings and eschool are about.
