QUESTIONS:

From: susan wunder   - happycow@earthlink.net
Subject:  Netscape 6 ruined all my pictures?


I need help and I don't know who to ask - I'm VERY new
at this.

I downloaded Netscape 6 and it has ruined all the pictures
I had scanned and saved when I had Netscape 4.  Can you
tell me how to fix it?  I tried to re-download 4 but I guess
once you have 6 you can't go back!  Every picture I try to
print now comes out all black.  Any suggestions?

I appreciate any help you can give me or someplace you
can tell me to go to look the info up.  Please keep in mind
the instructions you give me have to be VERY basic, I
know nothing!!!

Thanks so much  - Susan

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #142:  http://www.sharesmiles.com

Fun, neat site. Quick loading, and very easy to navigate.
The design was simple, but it was easy to find things.
On the joke page it said you could add your own jokes
but I didn't see any directions or form to do so.  I thought
the idea of the joke of the hour was neat.  On the games
page, underneath the link to send the page to friends it
says '50 work message' and should be 'word' instead of
'work'.

I think this would be a great site to include your contact
information, and a form for your visitors to submit ideas
to you on new things to include.
~~~~

Too many clashing colors.  The links at the bottom need
to be moved to top or the side for easy viewing.  Kind of
plain.  Would recommend a few more well made graphics
and a redesign on the table.
~~~~

I love the URL for your site, and did a lot of smiling at the
cartoons and jokes.  I would have liked to have seen some
personal input from you - what made you start this site,
why, for how long you've been doing this.  With a personal
touch and a feeling of getting to know you I would be more
inclined to visit again, like visiting an old friend. Your site
doesn't give me that feeling.

The layout was good, and the content was excellent, it just
felt like it was missing something.
~~~~

The tabbed interface is nice. But the center table with the 
border looks off center. Perhaps making the table more 
centered and higher/wider, maybe adding a bgcolor would help. 
~~~~

This is a very crisp and clean site. Colorful without being
too flashy. On the pages I would recommend moving the
menu with the links to the top of the page - I first thought
I had to use my back button to keep going back to the
choices.

I was impressed with the selection of games, jokes, and
everything you had on your site.  I bookmarked it to return
to, and that's something you could include (directions on
bookmarking your site).
~~~~

Fun Site which was easy to navigate and pages were clean-
looking. Had some fun playing some of the games which I
hadn't seen before.  Great site for a bit of relaxation... without
any HYPE or hard sell.  Loved it... congratulations.

<p>The tabbed interface is nice. But the center table with the
<br>border looks off center. Perhaps making the table more
<br>centered and higher/wider, maybe adding a bgcolor would help.

<p>This is a very crisp and clean site. Colorful without being
<br>too flashy. On the pages I would recommend moving the
<br>menu with the links to the top of the page - I first thought
<br>I had to use my back button to keep going back to the
<br>choices.
<p>I was impressed with the selection of games, jokes, and
<br>everything you had on your site.&nbsp; I bookmarked it to return
<br>to, and that's something you could include (directions on
<br>bookmarking your site).
<br>~~~~
<p>Fun Site which was easy to navigate and pages were clean-
<br>looking. Had some fun playing some of the games which I
<br>hadn't seen before.&nbsp; Great site for a bit of relaxation... without
<br>any HYPE or hard sell.&nbsp; Loved it... congratulations.
