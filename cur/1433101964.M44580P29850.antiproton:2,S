Has the kid been told about his/her legal right to privacy from his/her 
parents?

The most useful suggestion up until now has been use of Tails LiveUSB w/ 
persistence.
I'm not sure if Truecrypt is still bundled with Tails. If not, keeping 
the installer inside persistent volume isn't that inconvenient and use 
of steganographic volumes helps with the 5-dollar wrench problem.

The kid has the right to be curious about computing, programming and 
whatnot, so it should be straightforward to explain why the distro needs 
to be installed. Avoiding the privacy side of discussion might also be 
beneficial.
