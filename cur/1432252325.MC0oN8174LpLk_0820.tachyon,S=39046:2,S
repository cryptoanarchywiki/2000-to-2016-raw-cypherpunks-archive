Abstract

    Periodically there are proposals to require the use of a special top
    level name or an IP address bit to flag "adult" or "safe" material or
    the like.  This document explains why this is an ill considered idea.

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


1. Background

    The concept of a .xxx, .sex, or similar top-level domain is
    periodically suggested by politicians and commentators. Other
    proposals have included a domain reserved exclusively for material
    viewed as appropriate for minors, or using IP address bits or ranges
    to segregate content.

    In an October 1998 report accompanying the Child Online Protection
    Act, the House Commerce committee said "there are no technical
    barriers to creating an adult domain, and it would be very easy to
    block all websites within an adult domain." The report also said that
    the committee was wary of regulating the computer industry and that
    any decision by the U.S. government "will have international
    consequences." [HOUSEREPORT]

    British Telecom has backed adult top-level domains, saying in a 1998
    letter to the U .S. Department of Commerce that it "strongly
    supported" that plan. The reason: "Sexually explicit services could
    then be legally required to operate with domain names in this gTLD
    [that] would make it much simpler and easier to control access to
    such sites..." [BT] One of ICANN's progenitors, the GTLD-MOU
    committee, suggested a "red-light -zone" top-level domain in a
    September 1997 request for comment. [GTLD-MOU]

    Some adult industry executives have endorsed the concept. In 1998,
    Seth Warshavsky, president of the Internet Entertainment Group, told
    the U.S. Senate Commerce committee that he would like to see a .adult
    domain. "We're suggesting the creation of a new top-level domain
    called '.adult' where all sexually explicit material on the Net would
    reside," Warshavsky said in an interview at the time. [WARSHAVSKY]
    More recently, other entrepreneurs in the industry have said that
    they do not necessarily object to the creation of an adult domain as
    long as they may continue to use .com.

    Conservative groups in the U.S. say they are not eager for such a
    domain, and prefer criminal laws directed at publishers and
    distributors of sexually-explicit material.  The National Law Center
    for Children and Families in Fairfax, Virginia, said in February 2001
    that it did not favor any such proposal. For different reasons, the
    American Civil Liberties Union and civil liberties groups also oppose
    it.

    Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the U.S. Democratic Party's vice presidential
    nominee, endorsed the idea at a June 2000 meeting of the federal
    Commission on Child Online Protection. Lieberman said in a prepared
    statement that "we would ask the arbiters of the Internet to simply
    abide by the same standard as the proprietor of an X-rated movie
    theater or the owner of a convenience store who sells sexually-
    explicit magazines." [LIEBERMAN]


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                   [Page 3]

    In the 1998 law creating this commission, the U.S. Congress required
    the members to investigate "the establishment of a domain name for
    posting of any material that is harmful to minors." The commission
    devoted a section of its October 2000 report to that topic. It
    concluded that both a .xxx and a .kids domain are technically
    possible, but would require action by ICANN. The report said that an
    adult domain might be only "moderately effective" and raises privacy
    and free speech concerns. [COPAREPORT]

    The commission also explored the creation of a so-called red zone or
    green zone for content by means of allocation of a new set of IP
    addresses under IPv6. Any material not in one of those two zones
    would be viewed as in a grey zone and not necessarily appropriate or
    inappropriate for minors. Comments from commissioners were largely
    negative: "Effectiveness would require substantial effort to attach
    content to specific I P numbers. This approach could potentially
    reduce flexibility and impede optimal network performance. It would
    not be effective at blocking access to chat, newsgroups, or instant
    messaging."

    In October 2000, ICANN rejected a .xxx domain during its initial
    round of approving additional top-level domains. The reasons are not
    entirely clear, but former ICANN Chairwoman Esther Dyson said that
    the adult industry did not entirely agree that such a domain would be
    appropriate. One .xxx hopeful, ICM Registry of Ontario, Canada, in
    December 2000 asked ICANN to reconsider its decision. [ICM-REGISTRY]



2. Legal and Philisophical Problems

    When it comes to sexually-explicit material, every person, court, and
    government has a different view of what's acceptable and what is not.
    Attitudes change over time, and what is viewed as appropriate in one
    town may spark protests in the next. When faced with the slippery
    nature of what depictions of sexual activity should be illegal or
    not, one U.S. Supreme Court justice blithely defined obscenity as: "I
    know it when I see it."

    In the U.S., obscenity is defined as explicit sexual material that,
    among other things, violates "contemporary community standards" -- in
    other words, even at the national level, there is no agreed-upon rule
    governing what is illegal and what is not. Making matters more knotty
    is that there are over 200 United Nations country codes, and in most
    of them political subdivisions can impose their own restrictions.
    Even for legal nude modeling, age restrictions differ. They're
    commonly 18 years of age, but only 17 years of age in Sweden. A
    photographer in Oslo conducting what's viewed as a legal and proper
    photo shoot there likely would be branded a felon and child
    pornographer in the U.S.


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                   [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China are not likely to have the same liberal
    views as, say, the Netherlands. Saudi Arabia, like some other
    nations, filters its Internet connection and has created a government
    committee to protect its society from web sites that officials view
    as immoral. Their views on what should be included in a .xxx domain
    would hardly be identical to those in more liberal democracies.

    Those wildly different opinions on sexual material make it improbable
    a global consensus can ever be reached on what is appropriate or
    inappropriate for a .xxx or .adult top-level domain. Moreover, the
    existence of such a domain would create an irresistible temptation on
    the part of conservative legislators to require controversial
    publishers to move to that domain.

    Some conservative politicians already have complained that ICANN did
    not approve .xxx in its October 2000 meeting. During a February 2001
    hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives, legislators warned that
    they "want to explore ICANN's rationale for not approving two
    particular top level domain names -- .kids and .xxx -- as a means to
    protect kids from the awful smut which is so widespread on the
    Internet."

    It seems plausible that only a few adult publishers, and not those
    who have invested resources in building a brand around a .com site,
    would voluntarily abandon their current domain name. Instead, they'd
    likely add a propel legislators in the U.S. and other countries to
    require them to publish exclusively from an adult domain, a move that
    would invite ongoing political interference with Internet governance
    and raise concerns about forced speech and self-labeling.

    In fact, the ultimate arbiter of generic top-level domain names -- at
    least currently -- is not ICANN, but the U.S. government. The U.S.
    Congress' General Accounting Office in July 2000 reported that the
    Commerce Department continues to be responsible for domain names
    allowed by the authoritative root. [GAO] The GAO's auditors concluded
    it was unclear whether the Commerce Department has the "requisite
    authority" under current law to transfer that responsibility to
    ICANN.

    The American Civil Liberties Union -- and other members of the
    international Global Internet Liberty Campaign -- caution that
    publishers speaking frankly about birth control, AIDS prevention, and
    gay and lesbian sex could be coerced into moving to an adult domain.
    Once there, they would be stigmatized and easily blocked by schools,
    libraries, companies, and other groups using filtering software.
    Publishers of such information who do not view themselves as
    pornographers and retain their existing addresses could be targeted
    for prosecution.

    The existence of an adult top-level domain would likely open the door


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                   [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    for related efforts, either policy or legislative. There are many
    different axes through which offensive material can be defined: Sex,
    violence, hate, heresy, subversion, blasphemy, illegal drugs,
    profanity, political correctness, glorification of crime, incitement
    to break the law, and so on. Such suggestions invite the ongoing
    lobbying of ICANN, the U.S. government, or other policy-making bodies
    by special-interest groups that are not concerned with the technical
    feasibility or practicality of their advice.

    An adult top-level domain could have negative legal repercussions by
    endangering free expression. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
    O'Connor has suggested that the presence of "adult zones" on the
    Internet would make a future Communications Decency Act (CDA) more
    likely to be viewed as constitutional. In her partial dissent to the
    Supreme Court's rejection of the CDA in 1997 [CDA], O'Connor said
    that "the prospects for the eventual zoning of the Internet appear
    promising." (The Supreme Court ruled the CDA violated free speech
    rights by making it a crime to distribute "indecent" or "patently
    offensive" material online.)

    Privacy could be harmed by such a proposal. It would become easier
    for repressive governments and other institutions to track visits to
    sites in a domain labeled as adult and record personally-identifiable
    information about the visitor. Repressive governments would instantly
    have more power to monitor naive users and prosecute them for their
    activities. It's also not clear how effective a top-level domain
    would be when controlling access to chat, email, newsgroups and
    instant messaging.



4. Technical Difficulties

    Even ignoring the philosophical and legal difficulties outlined
    above, there are substantial technical difficulties in attempting to
    impose content classification by domain names or IP addresses.
    Mandatory content labeling is usually advanced with the idea of using
    a top level domain name, discussed in section 4.1 below, but we also
    discuss the more fundamental possibility of using IP address bits or
    ranges in section 4.2 below.

    In section 4.3 difficulties with a few particular higher level
    protocols are discussed.  In some cases, these protocols use
    different name spaces.

    We also discuss PICS labels [PICS] as an alternative technology in
    section 4.4.

    Only a limited technical background is assumed so some basic
    information is included below and in some cases descriptions are


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                   [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    simplified.



4.1 Domain Name System (DNS) and Other Names

    The most prominent user visible part of Internet naming and
    addressing is the domain name system [RFC 1034, 1035].  Domain Names
    are dotted sequences of labels such as aol.com, world.std.com,
    www.rosslynchapel.org.uk, or ftp.gnu.lcs.mit.edu [RFC 1035, 1591,
    2606].  They form an important part of most World Wide Web addresses
    or URLs [RFC 2396], commonly appearing right after "//".

    Actually, domain names just name nodes in a global distributed
    hierarchically delegated database.  A wide variety of information can
    be stored at these nodes including IP addresses of machines on the
    network (see section 4.2 below), such things as mail delivery
    information, and many other types of information.  Thus, the data
    stored at foo.example.com could be the numeric information for
    sending data to a particular machine, which would be used if you
    tried to browse <http://foo.example.com>, the name of a computer (say
    mailhost.example.com) to handle mail addressed to anyone
    @foo.example.com, and other information.

    There are also other naming systems in use, such as news group names
    and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel names.

    The usual labeling idea presented is to reserve a top level name,
    such as .xxx for "adult" material and/or .kids for "safe" material or
    the like.  Ignoring the definitional and legal problems there are
    technical and linguistic problems with this are described in the
    subsections below.



4.1.1 Linguistic Problems

    When using name labeling, the first problem is from whose language do
    you take the names to impose?  Words and acronyms can have very
    different meanings if different languages and the probability of
    confusion is multiplied when phonetic collisions are considered.

    As an example of possible problems, note that currently the
    government of Turkmenistan has suspended new registrations in ".tm",
    which had previously been a source of revenue, because some of the
    registered second level domain names may have been "legally obscene
    in Turkmenistan".  <http://www.nic.tm>

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


4.1.2 The DNS Hierarchy and Use of TLDs

    An important aspect of the design of the Domain Name System (DNS) is
    the hierarchical delegation of data maintenance.  The DNS really only
    works, and has been able to scale the five orders of magnitude it has
    grown since its initial deployment, only due to this delegation.

    The first minor problem is that one would expect most computers or
    web sites to have a mix of material only some of which should be
    specially classified.  Using special TLDs multiples the number of DNS
    zones the site has to worry about.  For example, assume the site has
    already sorted its material into "kids", "normal, and "adult" piles.
    Without special TLD labels, it can store them under kids.example.net,
    adult.example.net, and other.example.net, for instance, which
    requires only the maintenance of the single example.net zone of
    database entries.  With special TLD labeling, at least example.net
    (for normal stuff), example.net.xxx, and example.net.kids would need
    to be maintained which are three separate zones in different parts of
    the DNS tree.  As the number of categories expands and the number of
    category combinations explodes, this quickly becomes completely
    unmanageable.



4.1.2 You Can't Control Who Points At You

    The DNS system works as a database and associates certain data,
    called resource records, or RRs, with domain names.  In particular,
    it can associate IP address resource records with domain names.  For
    example, when you browse a URL, most commonly the domain name within
    that URL is looked up in the DNS and the resulting address (see
    Section 4.2) is used to address the packets sent from your web
    browser or other software to the server or peer.

    Remember what we said in Section 4.1.1 about hierarchical delegation?
    Anyone controlling a DNS zone of data, say example.com, can insert
    data at that name or any deeper name (except to the extent they
    maintain delegations of some of the deeper namespace to yet others).
    So the controller of example.com can insert data so that
    purity.example.com has stored at it the same computer address which
    is at www.obscene.example.xxx.  This directs any reference to
    purity.example.com to use the associated IP address which is the same
    as the www.obscene.example.xxx web site.  The manager of that
    hypothetical web site, who controls the example.xxx zone, has no
    control over the example.com DNS zone and so is technically incapable
    of causing it to conform to any "xxx" labeling law.  Or, in the
    alternative, someone could create a name conforming to an adult
    labeling requirement that actually pointed to someone else's entirely
    unobjectionable site, perhaps for the purpose of polluting the
    labeling.


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                   [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    Thus, providers of data on the Internet cannot stop anyone from
    creating names pointing to their computer's IP address with
    misleading domain names.



4.1.3 Particular Protocol Considerations

    There are additional considerations related to particular protocols.
    We consider only a few here.  The first two, electronic mail and the
    World Wide Web, use domain name addressing.  The second two, net news
    and IRC, actually use different name spaces and illustrate further
    technical problems with name based labeling.



4.1.3.1 Electronic Mail (SMTP)

    The standard Internet electronic mail protocol separates "envelope"
    information from content [RFC 821, 822].  The envelope information
    indicates where a message claims to have originated and to whom it
    should be delivered.  The content has fields starting with labels
    like "From:" and "To:" but these actually have no effect and can be
    arbitrarily forged using simple normally available software, such a
    telnetting to the SMTP port on a mail server.  Content fields are not
    compared with envelope fields.

    While different mail client display envelope information and headers
    from the content of email differently, generally the more common
    content fields are given prominence.  Thus, while not exactly the
    same as content labeling, it should be noted that it is trivial to
    send mail to anyone with arbitrary domain names in the email
    addresses appearing in the From and To headers, etc.

    It is also easy set up a host to forward mail to a mailing list.
    Mail sent with normal mail tools to this forwarder will automatically
    have content headers reflecting the forwarder's name but the
    forwarder will change the envelope information and cause the mail to
    be actually sent to the original list.  For example, (with names
    disguised) there is a social mailing list innocuous@foo.example.org
    and someone set up a forwarder at cat-torturers@other.example.  Mail
    sent to the forwarder is forwarded and appears on the innocuous
    mailing list but with a "To: cat-torturers@other.example" header in
    its body.  In some cases, similar things can be done using the "bcc"
    or blind courtesy copy feature of Internet mail.

    Thus, standard Internet tools provide no way to control domain names
    appearing inside email headers.

    There is work proceeding on securing email; however, such efforts at

    was the actual author of the mail.  They do not generally relate to
    controlling or authenticating domain names in the content of the
    mail.



4.1.3.2 Web Access (HTTP)

    At least with modern web servers and browsers supporting HTTP 1.1
    [RFC 2616], the domain name used to access the site is available to
    access different web sites even though they are on the same machine
    at the same IP address.

    (more to come)



4.1.3.3 News (NNTP)

    Net news uses hierarchical structured newsgroup names that are
    similar in appearance to domain names except that the most
    significant label is on the left and the least on the right, the
    opposite of domain names.  However, while the names are structured
    hierarchically, there is no central control.  Instead, news servers
    periodically connect to other news servers that have agreed to
    exchange messages with them and then they update each other on
    messages only in those newsgroups in which they wish to exchange
    messages.

4.1.3.4 Internet Relay Chat

    Internet Relay Chat is another example of a service which uses a
    different name space.  (more to come)



4.2 IP Addressing

    A key characteristic of the Internet Protocol (IP) on which the
    Internet is based is that it breaks data up into "packets".  These
    packets are individually handled and routed from source to
    destination.  Each packet has in it a numeric address for the
    destination point to which the Internet will try to deliver the
    packet.



D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                  [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    (End users do not normally see these numeric addresses but instead
    deal with "domain names" as described in section 4.1 above.)

    The numeric address system now primarily in use is called IPv4, or
    Internet Protocol Version 4, which provides for 32 bit addresses.
    There is a move to migrate to IPv6, which provides for 128 bit
    addresses.

    One problem in using addressing for content filtering is that this is
    a very coarse technique.  IP addresses address network interfaces
    which usually correspond to entire computer systems which could house
    multiple web pages, sets of files, etc., only a small part of which
    it was desired to block or enable.  Increasingly, a single IP address
    may correspond to a NAT (Network Address Translation) box [NAT] which
    hides multiple computers behind it, although in that case these
    computers are usually not servers.

    However, even beyond this problem of coarse granularity, the
    practical constraints of hierarchical routing make the allocation of
    even a single IPv4 address bit or any significant number of IPv6
    address bits impossible.



4.2.1 Hierarchical Routing

    As packets of data flow through the Internet, decisions must be made
    as to how to forward them "towards" their destination.  This is
    normally done by comparing the initial bits of the packet destination
    address to entries in a "routing table" and forwarding the packets as
    indicated by the table entry with the longest prefix match.

    While the Internet is actually a general mesh, if, for simplicity, we
    consider it to have a central backbone at the "top", a packet is
    typically routed as follows:

    The local networking code looks at its routing table to determine if
    the packet should be sent directly to another computer on the "local"
    network, to a router to specially forward it to another nearby
    network, or routed "up" to a "default" router to forward it to a
    higher level service provider's network.  If the packet's destination
    is "far enough away" it will eventually get forwarded up to a router
    on the backbone.  Such a router can not sent the packet "up" since it
    is at the top or "default free" zone and must have a complete table
    of what other top level router to send the packet to.  Currently,
    such top level routers are very large and expensive devices. They
    must be able to maintain tables of tens of thousands of routes.  When
    the packet gets to the top level router of the part of the network
    within which its destination lies, it get forwarded "down" to
    successive routers which are more and more specific and local until


D. Eastlake 3rd, D. McCullagh                                  [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT         .xxx Considered Dangerous           February 2001


    eventually its gets to a router on the local network where its
    destination address lies.  This local router sends the packet
    directly to the destination computer.

    Because all of these routing decisions are made on a longest prefix
    match basis, it can be seen that IP addresses are not general names
    or labels but are intimately associated with the actual topology and
    routing structure of the network.  If there were assigned at random,
    routers would be required to remember so many specific routes for
    specific addresses that it would exceed the current technical
    capabilities for router design.

    It should also be noted that there is some inefficiency in allocation
    at each level of hierarchy.  Generally allocations are of a power of
    two addresses and as requirements grow and/or shrink, it is not
    practical to use every address for a computer.

    (The above simplified description ignores multi-homing and many other
    details.)



4.2.2 IP Version 4 Addresses

    There just isn't any practical way to reallocate even one bit of IPv4
    global Internet Addresses for content filtering use.  Such addresses
    are in short supply and such an allocation would, in effect, cut the
    number of available addresses in half.  There just aren't enough
    addresses, given the efficiency of hierarchical allocation and
    routing, to do this.  Even if there were, current numbers have not be
    allocated with this in mind so that a renumbering within every
    organization with hosts on the Internet would be required, a
    nightmarish and Herculean task costing in the billions of dollars.
    Even if these problems were overcome, the allocation of even a single
    bit would likely double the number of routes in the default free
    zone, exceeding the capacity of current routers and requiring the
    upgrade of thousands of them to new routers that do not exist yet.

    And all this is for only a single bit, let alone more than one, is
    allocated to content labeling.

    Basically, the idea is a non-starter.



4.2.3 IP Version 6 Addresses

    IPv6 provides 128 bit address fields.  (more to come)

4.3 PICS Labels

    PICS Labels [PICS] have several modes.  If content is required to
    have labels in it, it raises all the problems of categorization
    granularity and forced speech.  But if used in a mode whereby a third
    party determines and provides labels for content and users are free
    to select whatever such third party or parties they wish to consult,
    it is a way to permit a myriad of categories, editors, and evaluators
    to exist in parallel.
