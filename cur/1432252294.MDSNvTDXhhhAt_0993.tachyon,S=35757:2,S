        Here at StockUpTicks we try to be very selective
        regarding the companies that we expose to our
        membership. Since we're not a "pump", "tout", or
        "hype" service and don't render opinion about our
        featured companies, we'll never pressure you to buy or
        sell these stocks.  However, we are very proud of the
        performance of our featured companies.  Before you read
        about BioSecure, today's featured company, take a look
        at how each of the companies we've featured over the
        last couple of months have performed.

         All percentages below are based on today's close (Nov.
                                16, 2001)
                                  Price

                        4, 2001

                ***That's an average increase of 47%***
          Remember, these aren't necessarily the highest prices
            since our mailings.  Rather, these are the actual
           percentages based on today's prices compared to the
                   trading day BEFORE we published.
           In some cases the stocks have actually traded much
                                 higher.
               ------------------------------------------

          Today's Featured Company is BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI)
               (Presently Known As Yes Clothing Co.  Inc)

          As company's inevitably succeed or fail in the
          publicly traded arena, their listings are often
          acquired by new companies in what is known as a
          reverse merger. In this instance, BioSecure has
          acquired the "shell" of Yes Clothing Co. for its own
          purposes.  Obviously, Yes Clothing Co. is no longer
          an active part of this publicly traded vehicle and
          the stock symbol (YCCI) is now reflective of the
          business plan of BioSecure Corporation.

          Effective personal protection is essential to any
          person who may be exposed to potentially hazardous
          substances. Since the Sepember 11th attacks changed
          our lives forever, many believe that situations may
          arise when people at home or work may be exposed to
          bio-hazards. BioSecure will develop, license,
          purchase, and market bio-technical products to
          consumers and businesses to assist in preventing or
          minimalizing any exposure to harmful biological or
          chemical agents.

          In the tradition of Stocknight and Stockupticks, we
          have asked BioSecure to publish its press release
          after the market closed today so that our members get
          to see it first and have time to research and decide
          before the entire market reacts on Monday.

          Press Release
          SOURCE: Yes Clothing Company Inc.

              Yes Clothing Company Inc. Board of Directors
                               Approves
                     Name Change to BioSecure Corp.

             Company to Develop, License and Market Personal
                     Bio-Hazard Protection Products

          NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16,
          2001--Yes Clothing Company Inc. (OTCBB:YCCI - news)
          today announced that the company's board of directors
          has approved the company's name change from Yes
          Clothing Company Inc. to BioSecure Corp.

          The company intends to identify and develop, license,
          purchase and market bio-technical and other personal
          protection products under the name BioSecure Corp.

          The name change resolution adopted by the board will
          be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
          Commission and
          shareholders in accordance with the current proxy
          rules, within the next few weeks.

          All shareholders of record will receive instructions
          on where to send their existing certificates in
          exchange for new certificates.  Subject to approval,
          the company will effect its name change, a
          corresponding change of CUSIP number and a change in
          the trading symbol within the next 60 days.

          ``The name change will effectively separate the
          company's historical business from its future
          activities,'' said Jon Lawver, corporate secretary
          and director of Yes Clothing. ``The board is
          enthusiastic about entering this market at a time
          when the world is on heightened alert and there is an
          obvious need for personal protection products.

          ``The BioSecure name will better represent the
          personal protection products the company will be
          developing and marketing.  The recent bio-terrorism
          events have made it clear that hazardous materials
          are now part of our daily lives and BioSecure
          products will be introduced to address everything
          from anthrax to the more mundane bio-hazards that
          exist in every business and residence, like copier
          toner and cleaning products.''

<p>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16, 2001--Yes Clothing
Company Inc. (OTCBB:YCCI - news) today announced that the company's board
of directors has approved the company's name change from Yes Clothing Company
Inc. to BioSecure Corp.&nbsp;
<p>The company intends to identify and develop, license, purchase and market
bio-technical and other personal protection products under the name BioSecure
Corp.&nbsp;
<p>The name change resolution adopted by the board will be submitted to
the Securities and Exchange Commission and
<br>shareholders in accordance with the current proxy rules, within the
next few weeks.&nbsp;
<p>All shareholders of record will receive instructions on where to send
their existing certificates in exchange for new certificates.&nbsp; Subject
to approval, the company will effect its name change, a corresponding change
of CUSIP number and a change in the trading symbol within the next 60 days.&nbsp;
<p>``The name change will effectively separate the company's historical
business from its future activities,'' said Jon Lawver, corporate secretary
and director of Yes Clothing. ``The board is enthusiastic about entering
this market at a time when the world is on heightened alert and there is
an obvious need for personal protection products.&nbsp;
<p>``The BioSecure name will better represent the personal protection products
the company will be developing and marketing.&nbsp; The recent bio-terrorism
events have made it clear that hazardous materials are now part of our
daily lives and BioSecure products will be introduced to address everything
from anthrax to the more mundane bio-hazards that exist in every business
and residence, like copier toner and cleaning products.''&nbsp;

<p>About Yes Clothing&nbsp;
