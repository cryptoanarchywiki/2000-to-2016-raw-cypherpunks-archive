Subject:  New virus alert

I received notice of a new virus last week, and didn't pay much 
attention until I started receiving copies. Just thought others 
might like a heads up or more information about this.

It's called the SirCam virus, and when it spreads, it sends 
an apparently random file from the harddrives of infected 
computers along with it. ANY file on your machine could 
be copied and sent to hundreds of other users. In some
cases that could be simply embarassing. In others, depending
on the contents of the file, it could be quite costly.

The files I've gotten have ranged from 200k to slightly over 300k.
For more info check out: 
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@mm.html
and http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-6647394.html?tag=owv

For a fix, visit  http://www.kaspersky.com/ for a trial download 
that will clean it out.

sounds like a Packard Bell.

arkdoshk.vxd is a virtual device driver that can sometimes
be overwritten by an update of DirectX. It's absence will
not harm your system.

Click "Start" and "Run"
type "Sysedit"
Erase this line from the SYSTEM.INI
[386enh] section: DEVICE=ARKDOSHK.VXD
Save and exit.

You should no longer be bothered with this.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #139:  http://www.healthynewage.com
healthychoice@earthlink.net
~~~~

This is a nice looking site, but I do have some recommendations
just to make it a little easier.
1 - The look of the  logo and first sentence "A Healthy 
New Age..." with a serif font just didn't seem to fit with 
the color and style of the rest of the site.
2 - As someone unfamiliar with new age stuff, I would have 
liked more of an introduction to describe what I would find
at your site.
3 - There is a LOT of information and links on the home page.
It might just be me, but I don't like so many decisions on 
what link to click on or where to go. By dividing this information 
up into main categories, then sub-categories, I wouldn't have 
felt overwhelmed.
~~~~

Cool background. I wish you hadn't covered it up with the 
white text box. But if you are using a text box / table, instead 
of centering all the information, I'd separate those links into 
side by side cells, eliminating a lot of white space and scrolling.
~~~~

This is a fast-loading site, with very extensive information on 
new age products and practices. I thought the 'alphabet soup 
challenge' was a neat idea, and you definitely have a lot of 
content.  

With the layout, try to stick to one background print, and one 
related background color for the other pages if you don't want 
to always use the print. While the topics all related to new 
age, the pages didn't seem to relate at all with the different 
borders and colors for every page.

Having webmaster recommendations, I think you need to share 
information about yourself, I didn't find any contact information 
on the whole site. Great job with your meta tags, I would think 
you rate pretty high with search engines.  
~~~~

Healthy new age was a unique site, with a fun layout and 
graphics that felt artsy, but with no photographs everything 
seemed to load quickly.  I was glad to see the site index as 
there was almost too much on the home page, but thought 
the site index should have been closer to the top of the page.

I clicked on some of the links, checking out the alphabet soup 
challenge, and some of the articles and mall stores. I was 
confused by the 'Enter the star gates' in the motivation central 
section, as I didn't know what the star gates were. A description 
or more information would be helpful by some of these links.
~~~~

Calm and relaxing site. Well planned and informative. Pages 
load quickly. Lots of time needed to visit everything, but 
heaps of interesting features.

The white parts of the first page could be the same soft green 
as the rest (the white might be disguising a white square 
background behind the logo?) I just found the white a tad 
harsh with the soft green.

This:MY CREATE ABUNDANCE CORNER
Webmaster Resources Center                        
The colour is out of sync. with the overall scheme.

Does the site have music? (I don't have a sound card) I think 
adding music to it would be great.  I've bookmarked lots of 
things from this site.  Very nice site!

<p>This is a nice looking site, but I do have some recommendations
<br>just to make it a little easier.
<br>1 - The look of the&nbsp; logo and first sentence "A Healthy
<br>New Age..." with a serif font just didn't seem to fit with
<br>the color and style of the rest of the site.
<br>2 - As someone unfamiliar with new age stuff, I would have
<br>liked more of an introduction to describe what I would find
<br>at your site.
<br>3 - There is a LOT of information and links on the home page.
<br>It might just be me, but I don't like so many decisions on
<br>what link to click on or where to go. By dividing this information
<br>up into main categories, then sub-categories, I wouldn't have
<br>felt overwhelmed.
<br>~~~~
<p>Cool background. I wish you hadn't covered it up with the
<br>white text box. But if you are using a text box / table, instead
<br>of centering all the information, I'd separate those links into
<br>side by side cells, eliminating a lot of white space and scrolling.
<br>~~~~
<p>This is a fast-loading site, with very extensive information on
<br>new age products and practices. I thought the 'alphabet soup
<br>challenge' was a neat idea, and you definitely have a lot of
<br>content.
<p>With the layout, try to stick to one background print, and one
<br>related background color for the other pages if you don't want
<br>to always use the print. While the topics all related to new
<br>age, the pages didn't seem to relate at all with the different
<br>borders and colors for every page.
<p>Having webmaster recommendations, I think you need to share
<br>information about yourself, I didn't find any contact information
<br>on the whole site. Great job with your meta tags, I would think
<br>you rate pretty high with search engines.
<br>~~~~
<p>Healthy new age was a unique site, with a fun layout and
<br>graphics that felt artsy, but with no photographs everything
<br>seemed to load quickly.&nbsp; I was glad to see the site index as
<br>there was almost too much on the home page, but thought
<br>the site index should have been closer to the top of the page.
<p>I clicked on some of the links, checking out the alphabet soup
<br>challenge, and some of the articles and mall stores. I was
<br>confused by the 'Enter the star gates' in the motivation central
<br>section, as I didn't know what the star gates were. A description
<br>or more information would be helpful by some of these links.
<br>~~~~
<p>Calm and relaxing site. Well planned and informative. Pages
<br>load quickly. Lots of time needed to visit everything, but
<br>heaps of interesting features.
<p>The white parts of the first page could be the same soft green
<br>as the rest (the white might be disguising a white square
<br>background behind the logo?) I just found the white a tad
<br>harsh with the soft green.
<p>This:MY CREATE ABUNDANCE CORNER
<br>Webmaster Resources Center
<br>The colour is out of sync. with the overall scheme.
<p>Does the site have music? (I don't have a sound card) I think
<br>adding music to it would be great.&nbsp; I've bookmarked lots of
<br>things from this site.&nbsp; Very nice site!
