President Empowers Communities in Fight Against Illegal Drug Abuse 
REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN SIGNING DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES ACT
REAUTHORIZATION BILL
Omni Shoreham Hotel Washington, D.C.
 
REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN SIGNING DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES ACT
REAUTHORIZATION BILL 
125 P.M. EST 

PRESIDENT Thank you all very much. It’s an honor to be here. Let me
first say, we’re winning. (Applause.) We’ve got a new war, and I want
you to know your government is doing everything we can to defeat those
who hate freedom. We will defeat them abroad, thanks to a fabulous
military. (Applause.) We are patient, we’re relentless because our cause
is just and it is noble. Plus we’re doing everything we can at home to
prevent the enemy from hitting us again. 

There’s another war at home, too, and that’s to win the war against the
scourge of drugs. (Applause.) I’m so glad—it’s an honor to be introduced
by America’s new Director of National Drug Policy Council. John Walters
brings a passionate concern and a strong background to the fight against
drugs. 

In the late 1980s, he was one of the architects of the federal
government’s most successful antidrug policies. And he’ll lead our
administration’s effort with determination and intelligence, with
resolve and moral clarity. I am proud to have John as a member of my
Cabinet. (Applause.) 

And I’m honored to speak to the Community Antidrug Coalitions of
America. I want to thank you all for being here. You’re a part of
America’s armies of compassion, examples of service and citizenship. You
restore hope to lives, and safety to neighborhoods. All Americans admire
your dedication. And the bill that I will soon sign will strengthen your
work. (Applause.)

We share an important commitment. For the sake of our children and for
the good of our nation, we will reduce drug use in America. I want to
thank General Art Dean for being the CEO of this important group of
soldiers in the armies of compassion. (Applause.) I want to thank the
three members of the United States Congress who stand up here with me
today, leaders in this important effort. Not only leaders in Washington,
but as you’ll soon hear, leaders in the communities in which they live.
Thank you so much for being here. (Applause.) 

Drug use threatens everything, everything that is best about our
country. It breaks the bonds between parents and children. It turns
productive citizens into addicts. It transforms schools into places of
violence and chaos. It makes playgrounds into crime scenes. It supports
gangs here at home. And abroad, it’s so important for Americans to know
that the traffic in drugs finances the work of terror, sustaining
terrorists -- (applause) -- that terrorists use drug profits to fund
their cells to commit acts of murder.  If you quit drugs, you join the
fight against terror in America.
(Applause.) 

And above all, we must reduce drug use for one great moral reason Over
time, drugs rob men, women, and children of their dignity, and of their
character. Illegal drugs are the enemies of ambition and hope. And when
we fight against drugs, we fight for the souls of our fellow Americans.
(Applause.) 

In this struggle, we know what works. We must aggressively and
unabashedly teach our children the dangers of drugs. We must
aggressively treat addiction wherever we find it. And we must
aggressively enforce the laws against drugs at our borders and in our
communities. (Applause.) 

America cannot pick and choose between these goals. All are necessary if
any are to be effective. And my administration will pursue these goals
with energy and focus and strong commitment.  It’s important for the
future of this country that we do so.  This comprehensive approach has
been tried before, and it has worked. From the mid ‘80s, to the early
‘90s, drug use amongst high school seniors was reduced each and every
year. Progress was steady, and over time, dramatic. Yet recently, we’ve
lost ground in this important battle. 

According to the most recent data, the percentage of 12th graders using
an illicit drug in the previous month rose from less than 15 percent in
1992 to about 25 percent in the year 2000. Over the same period, the
percentage of 10th graders using an illicit drug in the previous month
rose from 11 percent to more than 22 percent. Marijuana use amongst 8th
graders rose, while their perceptions of the dangers of marijuana use
fell. There was a similar decrease in the perception of risk involved
with LSD and powder and crack cocaine.  Behind these numbers are
countless personal tragedies. And my administration will not be
indifferent to them. We must return the fight against drugs to the
center of our national agenda.  (Applause.) 

And as we win this fight, America will be a more hopeful place. And as
we battle against a major, significant problem in America, and show
progress, this country’s promise will be more available to more of our
citizens. 

It’s a national imperative that we win. And I understand that you all
are amongst the most important allies we have to achieve this goal.
You’ve got a track record of success. You sponsor drug education
programs, and youth summits, and parent training courses.  You support
drug intervention programs, and foster great counseling services. You’re
helping to build a culture of responsibility, one that respects the law,
one that teaches our children right from wrong, and one that strengthens
our commitments to our fellow citizens.

In Troy, Michigan, the Troy Community Coalition for the Prevention of
Drug and Alcohol Abuse is building leadership skills to help teens to
say no to drugs and alcohol. As a result, alcohol use among high
schoolers has declined in dramatic fashion.  I want to thank Sandy
Levin, the Congressman from the great state of Michigan, who is on the
stage with us, for helping lead that effort. And I want to thank the
good people from Troy, Michigan, for standing up and doing what’s right
for your community.  (Applause.) 

I’m particularly proud that the coalition’s leader, Mary Ann Solberg,
has agreed to join John Walters as the Deputy Director of the National
Drug Control Policy. (Applause.) Now that you have your uniform on, go
get them. (Laughter.) 
Also on the stage with us is Congressman Rob Portman, who is the
President of the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati, a winner
of CADCA’s Outstanding Coalition Award. I understand his program well
because I saw it first hand in Cincinnati. I want to thank Rob for his
leadership. 

I appreciate this coalition’s practical approach, by providing tips to
parents on how to deal with drug use, provide financial incentives to
businesses that have drug-free workplace programs. And the most
aggressive antidrug media campaign is in Cincinnati—for a market its
size. The result is that for the first time in a decade, teen drug use
in greater Cincinnati is beginning to level off. They’re making great
progress in that important city. It goes to show what happens when our
nation invigorates the grass roots to deal with a problem that we must
solve, early, before it is too late. (Applause.) And also on this stage
is the fine United States Senator from the state of Iowa, Chuck
Grassley. He’s worked with the people of Iowa to begin what they call
the Face it Together Coalition, the first ever statewide antidrug
coalition led by a United States senator. The coalition has a
comprehensive workplace drug education program. It works with coalitions
around the state for best practices, for community based antidrug
efforts. It conducts workshops to train faith-based leaders on effective
drug prevention strategies.  Senator Grassley, I appreciate you taking
the lead.  (Applause.) It’s a hard job being a senator, but it’s easy to
forget the community responsibilities when you get elected to such a
high office as senator. And yet this Senator never forgot where he came
from. This Senator asked a question, what can I do—just like you asked
that question—what can I do, to improve the lives of the citizens of a
state he so dearly loves? And he chose to fight, stand side by side with
the good citizens of Iowa to fight drug use. And Mr. Senator, thank you
for your leadership.  (Applause.) 

I’m so happy to be able to sign an important piece of legislation in
your presence. The bill I sign today increases the total amount of funds
authorized for programs like the ones we just described from more than
$50 million a year in the current fiscal year to nearly $100 million by
the year 2007. (Applause.) It allows coalitions to reapply for grants
even after five years, as long -- (applause). Make sure you meet your
matching fund requirement. (Laughter and applause.)

It instructs Director Walters to focus the greatest resources on areas
of the greatest needs, by giving priority to coalitions that serve
economically-disadvantaged neighborhoods. The reauthorization bill
creates a new class of grants that will help established coalitions
assist new ones, assist new folks on how to battle this scourge called
drug use. (Applause.) 

And the bill creates a National Community Antidrug Coalition Institute
to provide education and training and technical assistance to coalitions
all throughout our country. (Applause.) 

There are other steps we must take. Many of you are working with
faith-based institutions, because you’ve seen the power of faith to
transform lives. Last month, the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University, led by Joe Califano, released a
report on substance abuse, religion and spirituality. The report found
that religion and spirituality can play a powerful role in the
prevention and treatment of substance abuse, and on the maintenance of
sobriety. 

My armies of compassion legislation will provide support to faith-based
institutions working to prevent and treat drug abuse. The House passed
this legislation. I urge the Senate to do so. This nation must not fear
faith-based programs, we must welcome them.  (Applause.) We must welcome
anybody who is willing to join in this important goal and in this
important cause.  We’ve got a responsibility here in Washington to lead
the fight against drug abuse. But we understand here that one of the
best ways to do so is to support the people in the neighborhoods, on the
streets, the community coalitions which are truly the front line in our
battle to save people’s lives. 

You’ve devoted your lives to the well-being of others, and for this I’m
incredibly grateful. On behalf of all Americans, thank you for your
compassion; thank you for your concern; thank you for your love for your
country and your fellow human being. 

And now it is my honor to invite Director Walters and General Dean,
along with the sponsors of this important piece of legislation to join
me as I sign this bill. May God bless you all, and may God bless
America. (Applause.)
