>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
> 
> 
>METHOD # 1:BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
> 
>Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we 
>Will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
>also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
>could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
>will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
>response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
>by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
>e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
>ordered Report # 2. 
> 
> 
>Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
>e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
> 
> 
>Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million 
>e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 
>4. 
> 
> 
>Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
>(50 million) e-mails. 
> 
> 
> 
>The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 
> 
> THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). 
>Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... 
>$5,000 + 4 .... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 
> 
> 
>NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT 
>THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
>CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
> 
> 
> 
>REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
>ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
> 
>Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
>one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are 
>over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
>many people will do just that, and more! 
> 
> 
> 
>METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
>Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
>of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
>easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
>and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
>must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
>same day service on all orders. 
> 
>This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
>address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
>receive the report. 
> 
>

>ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes:

>============================================== 
>Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report.

>population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. 
>Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later 
>she jumped in with both feet.

>I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on
