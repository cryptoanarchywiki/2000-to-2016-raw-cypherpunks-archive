This might seem horribly political and non-cp to some, but a good some
of it seems on topic to me. Perhaps ignore that which you consider
offtopic.

"A man, who has in mind an apparent advantage and promptly proceeds to
dissociate this from the question of what is right, shows himself to
be mistaken and immoral.  Such a standpoint is the parent of
assassinations, poisonings, forged wills, thefts, malversations of
public money, and the ruinous exploitation of provincials and Roman
citizens alike.  Another result is passionate desire – desire for
excessive wealth, for un-endurable tyranny, and ultimately for the
despotic seizure of free states.  These desires are the most horrible
and repulsive things imaginable.  The perverted intelligences of men,
who are animated by such feelings, are competent to understand the
material rewards, but not the penalties.  I do not mean penalties
established by law, for these they often escape.  I mean the most
terrible of all punishments:  their own degradation."

Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.)

I view the Australia of today as that of pre-war Nazi Germany;  the
truth is 'verboten' (forbidden).  Political correctness rules the
roost, truth suppressed.  When the absolutes of right and wrong, truth
and lies are abolished, usurped by political correctness, there is no
future for this country.  Politically enforced Multiculturalism will
be the means to its demise.  When Christianity is replaced by the evil
philosophy of 'Humanism", emanating from the equally evil United
Nations, normality will also be replaced by abnormality.  Right
becomes wrong and wrong becomes right.  That trend is now blatantly
obvious in the society of today.  Ironically passed into law by our
questionable legislators.  Sometime, somehow, someone will have to
answer for this warped minded, reverse thinking called:  political
correctness.

---
Federal Parliament consists of traitors and cowards on both sides.
How else can one explain the state of Australia today?  Those who keep
silent under duress are moral cowards as in political correctness, the
suppression of the truth.  "Political correctness is the evident child
of communism.  The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie
became truth.  In times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes
a revolutionary act."  (George Orwell)  Political correctness defined.

---
Politically enforced multiculturalism can best be described as
meaningless.  When your country and its people have lost their
homogeneous status, your heritage and identity eliminated by
un-assimable, alien races, bringing their own cultures with them, the
country will become a nation of tribes, speaking many languages;
meaningless.  A nation can survive within its own heritage, language
and culture, but not without them.  The abolition of the White
Australia Policy sounded the death knell for Australia.  "Ask not for
whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee, Australia, it tolls for thee",
genocide.

In a court of law, a person had to swear on the Bible to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I pose the
question, would the misuse of the word 'gay' be accepted as truth?
Would the legislators consider that before making a decision on the
issue?  I consider it to be Karl Marx dialectics, "words I choose all
mixed up in a devilish muddle so that anyone can choose to believe
whatever they choose to believe".  Discrimination for choice, racist
for patriot etc., right and wrong are absolutes and no political
correctness can alter that fact.  I hope the legislators are cognisant
of the word gay.  The dictionary defines it as "light-hearted,
mirthful, showy, dissolute".  "Dissolute as loose living, debauched".
Is that the kind of society that political correctness may impose and
enforce upon the people?

For people smugglers, read the United Nations, it is the intention of
that commo dominated organisation to recolonise the world.  The
Humanist Manifesto is the bible of the United Nations, it states, "We
deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds.  We have
reached a turning point in human history when the best option is to
transcend the limits on national sovereignty".  'Humanism' was
declared to be a religion by the Supreme Court of the USA in 1961.
The bible has been banned in American Courts.  The United Nations
Charter for World Government states:  "Increasing self-denial in the
exercise of sovereignty by the state, necessary for the better working
of the United Nations." The evil ideology of humanism is being
implemented by the UN.  The United Nations Charter for World
Government is based on treason.  All governments that participate in
its agenda, are traitors to their own people and nation.

In Support of John Bushell, Network News, June.  I quite agree with
you and I also pray:

Wait, wait, wait
Before the golden gate,
I leave behind my hate
For the traitors of my state.
Would I decide their fate
They'd go through the other gate,
Not to sit and dwell
But to burn in bloody hell.
Now you've heard of Guy Fawkes
And his gun powder plot,
I dreamt I was he
And blew up the lot.

Whatever legislators may pass into law, it must first pass my
conscience, whether to accept or reject it.  For my mind is my own, it
does not belong to legislators.  A mind that's forced against its will
is of the same opinion still.  We now live in an era of contradictions
of 'universal deceit', where right is now wrong and wrong is now
right.  We also have politically appointed but unelected commissions
to force this lunacy upon society.
"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do
nothing".  (Edmund Burke)
Politicians who keep silent under duress are moral cowards.
"One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is, that
you end up being governed by your inferiors".  (Plato)

The following quotations are just a few reasons why Australia, as
such, is now in a state of decline and eventual genocide.  Bob Hawke
admitted:  "That the major parties had reached an implicit pact to
keep immigration off the political agenda."  Deceit and collusion.  He
later stated:  "Multiculturalism is not negotiable".  So much for
democracy.  Malcolm Fraser re:  the Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees,
"I did not put it to the people because I knew that they would reject
it."  Al Grassby:  "The White Australia Policy is dead, give me a
shovel and I will bury it".  These are just a few examples of a
deliberate intention to destroy traditional European Australia.
Manning Clarke:  "I believe very strongly that we must fight for the
end of the Anglo-Saxon domination of Australia".  These were the
preliminaries to the abolition of the White Australia Policy by Gough
Whitlam;  genocide of Australians.  Advance Australia Where?

---
Politically enforced multiculturalism can be defined in the word:  MEANINGLESS.

When your identity has been diluted to the extremity of genocide by
the political imposition of alien races upon the host nation,
Australia, then you arrive at the meaning of the word 'meaningless'.
"Pour your pitchers of wine into the wide river and where is your
wine?  You have only the river".  (Kath Walker, Aboriginal poet in
'The Dawn Is At Hand'.

Treason = Genocide:

Genocide;  a word of which the official United Nations definition is:
"The committing of acts with intent to destroy – wholly or in part, a
national ethnic, racial or religious groups as such".  The United
Nations Convention of asylum seekers (illegal arrivals), is in breach
of their own statement to that effect.  Imposing alien races of people
upon a stable, inherited, homogenous nation of people is tantamount to
genocide of the host nation.  Brutus, Gough Whitlam, is the architect
of the 'genocide' of the Australian nation of people.  Like Brutus, he
stabbed White Australia in the back and instituted the policy of
multiculturalism, i.e., genocide.  Gough Whitlam, during his lifetime,
was a Marxist Fabian (commo) as is most of the Labor Party, hiding
under the Labor Party banner.  Menzies wanted to ban the Communist
Party in Australia;  he was over-ruled by the High Court and a
subsequent referendum on the matter.  The Federal Governments of
Whitlam and Hawke, the Commos were not under the bed, they were in it,
working to destroy Australia.  While representing UNESCO in Paris,
Whitlam promoted the concept of UNESCO BROWN MAN.  The mixing of all
races of people, a race-less, stateless, faceless, brown slob, devoid
of all character or heritage, the future person of the United Nations
New World Order.

N.B.  UN quote page 23 'Travel Warrant' by Bernard Ferguson.

Who is behind the United Nations Power Grab?

A powerful network of Americans in government, business, academia and
the media, have conspired to empower the United Nations.  One
noteworthy 'insider' is David Rockefeller – head of the super-rich
family that donated the land for the UN headquarters.  He told an
elite group in Germany in 1991:  "We are grateful to the Washington
Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, whose directors have attended
our meetings and respected promises of discretion – for almost 40
years.  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for
the world if we had been subject to publicity during those years.  But
the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a
world government."  Here is a sampling of what other globalists have
said:

Walter Cronkite, famous CBS news anchor said:  "We must strengthen the
United Nations as a first step toward a world government".

Strobe Talbott, former Deputy Secretary of State said:  "Nationhood as
we know it will be obsolete – all states will recognise a single,
global authority."

Colin Powell, former Secretary of State said:  "With respect to US
policy, when it comes to our role as a member of the Security Council
of the United Nations, we obviously are bound by UN resolutions."
