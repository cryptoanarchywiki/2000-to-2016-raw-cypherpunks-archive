Well, it's not necessarily immoral. So not necessarily criminal. Even 
your own dictionary definition of anarchy provides mentions a 
government. Albeit a minimal one. Governed you are. Whether it's by 
consensus, opt-in or otherwise.

? There is lots of that going around amongst humans. How do you suggest 
people defend themselves against /any /hostile force? Do you think that 
calling it a militia makes a difference? Having trained defenders of 
your homestead is no bad thing. It's actually quite smart.

Confusing them with lies and propaganda and making them shoot people 
that are innocent /is/ repugnant and immoral. But being confused or 
ignorant is not inherent to the institute . It's something that happens 
through lack of education and indoctrination through faith institutes 
(religion). Humans are fallible and on top of that, programmable.

Many of them suffer from a massive, violent even, cognitive dissonance 
if you talk about what they are actually doing. Once you turn back on 
the cause and effect part of their humanity it's all tears, anger and 
confusion. PTSD, shitty coping mechanisms. And you just put them all in 
a hole, categorizing like a common Nazi.

1*:*  a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to 
be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on 
voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY; i.e.: Government as in a society's 
organizational form, but not it's authority. I.e. Direct Democracy.

Government OR governmental restraint. Government non-the-less. Learn to 
read you illiterate :D

But yea, I agree that for the sake of the argument they could be 
considered mutually exclusive. If you want to abolish government. Which 
is kind of strange because every form of anarchism usually has an 
adjective regarding it's organization. Federated, syndicalists. All of 
them are organized in some fashion shape or form.

Now, I don't mind NOT calling that form a form of government. But I 
don't want to confuse people in to thinking that anarchism is some kind 
of synonym for chaos.
