Doesnt Surprise me,


    During the original publication cycle of PGP an effort was made to
reach out to mitch kapor and john perry barlow for aid from EFF but Jim
Bidsoz was already there with his lies that PGP was stolen/purloined
code and thus mitch/perry washed his hands of PGP. FUCK THEM..

FUCK MITCH KAPOR, FUCK JOHN PERRY BARLOW!!

and yes this list and so called movement(HAH!) was founded on Media
Manipulation/Braggarts/BS if you will) of the highest order, It even got
a greater push after we viewed an Inforwar Con V  presentation  in 1994
 called Red Teaming(it was an information attack on the structures of
the press(propaganda with a twist)).

And given Internet Sockpuppets :) its remarkably easy to be ones one
greek Chorus(and press army)..  in fact Anonymous vs the rootkit.com
founder was over "greek chorus" type of sockpuppet software that the
firm was developing , and while javascript turing scripts did pose
initial problems for same(sockpuppet software) when facebook and others
tried implementing them, call outs to the "mechnical turk" and later to
the Selenium plugin nowadays for the amateur efforts quickly solved that
technical issue.

Anonymous remailers have also been remarkably effective in hoodwinking
both the press corp and the public and even members of this list
 to swallow both the malware nostrums(mcafee and others)(hook) and later
PGP/other crypto/security crap (line and sinker).

This kind treatment of the truth was drove our first list foil Detweiler
stark raving bonkers and sent him raving on the list about tentacles of
MEDUSA especially after list participants picked up and started remailer
bombing him with a procmail script that someone thoughtfully published
to the list that would email him several (n+1)slightly different copies
of his own posted mail each time he posted.

Detweilers final demise from his position as one of the privileged
Sysadmins at the University when he carelessly replied to a type one
remailer block that contained his direct supervisors spouse's(wife)
email address among others(the chancellors of the university  email
addresses were included in that block.) thinking that he was instead
replying to one of his sockpuppet harassers(I believe it was tentacle
#69 who copped to this).

Badda bing Badda boom,, all 83 email addresses he had been abusing from
the university  position where he was employed were gone in 1 hour
etc...as was his job and privileged position from where he abused the
rest of the list.

David Sternlight was made of much stronger stuff :) ... Lance Detweiler
was MUCH more careless and thought he was one of the rulers of us..



      I LOVE this topic John!!
      GH
ps more on earlier list protagonists/propagandists later...statute of
limitations for all of these early list antics is of course LONG expired..

pss if Lance Detweiler had NOT stepped up we  would have had to create
him as a SOCKPUPPET..
