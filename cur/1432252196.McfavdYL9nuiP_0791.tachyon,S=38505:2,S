> HUMAN FACTORS
> 
> You can.t be effective if you make assumptions or let others intimidate
> you.
> - Don.t let others make you feel dumb.
> - Make no assumptions about security. It might be worse than you expect.
> - Don.t count on the accuracy of anything other people tell you, even if
> they work for the county or the vendor.
> - About party observers, techies, or lawyers: Remember that they have not
> examined the actual software or setup, and they are operating on
> assumptions, hearsay, or in some cases, may be trying to misdirect your
> attention.
> - Vendor contracts prohibit county officials from examining their own
> software. Elections officials may just be repeating what someone else (the
> vendor) has told them.
> 
> YOUR ROLE AS AN OBSERVER: CREATE YOUR OWN AUDIT LOG so it can be compared
> to the real audit log.
> 
> Write down the following. For every event, write the date, time, including
> minutes.
> 
> 1. NAMES & AFFILIATIONS: Get the names of everyone there. Find out
> affiliation.
> 
> 2. WHERE ARE THE COMPUTERS: Establish the number and location of all vote
> tabulation computers. They call them different things: tabulators,
> servers. What you want is the computer that adds up all the votes from
> everywhere in the county.
> - Some counties have only one. If there are more than one, find out where
> each one is. If there is more than one tabulator, ask if they are
> networked together and find out if any of them are in places you can.t
> observe.
> 
> 3. SYNCHRONIZE YOUR WATCH with the central vote-tally computer. Ask
> officials to tell you the time on the computer. If more than one, ask for
> the time of each and the ID number of each.
> 
> log the date and time, to the minute, in this format:
> Nov 02 2004 11:25 p.m.
> Nov. 03 2004 01:15 a.m.
> 
> CREATE A LOG FOR THE FOLLOWING:
> 
> People: Ask names and affiliations for, and log the START and STOP time
> for:
> 
> a. Who accesses the terminal (the keyboard and screen)
> b. Who sits at the terminal
> c. Who accesses the server (the computer the screen is hooked up to)
> d. Who enters and leaves the room
> 
> COMPUTER ACTIVITIES: Log the START and STOP time for the following events
> and write down the name of the person involved:
> 
> a. Putting disks, CDs, or any other item in the computer
> b. Taking disks, CDs, or any other item out of the computer
> c. Uploading disks, CDs, or any other item
> d. Viewing a preview of a report
> e. Putting a report on the Web, even if this is done from another computer
> f. Printing a report
> g. NOTE WHAT.S ON THE SCREEN: Use binoculars to view the screen.
> - Note upload icons.
> - Use binoculars to read and record error messages. Note the time.
> - Note indicators of processes, when a status bar shows how much is left
> to do
> 
> h. PROGRAM CRASHES:
> - Watch to see if the program suddenly disappears from the screen (a
> program crash) or any system error message appears. If so, note the time
> and other details, and see below for how to record system crashes.
> - Get the date and time and note who was at the computer
> - Note whether any results were being transmitted or uploaded at the time
> the crash occurred.
> - Did the crash take down the whole computer or did it just close the
> tabulator program unexpectedly.
> - Log all activities and conversations that occur just after the crash. If
> have a tape recorder, leave it in your purse, now is the time to turn it
> on. But keep making notes regardless of whether you have tape, and trust
> your gut. What you think might be important is probably important.
> 
> WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT MODEMS.
> 
> i. Note when, where, and who feeds ballot data into the computer in the
> central office. Describe what they are feeding the cards into, where the
> items are located, who does it, and when.
> 
> j. DISK MANAGEMENT:
> 
> - Note what kind of data storage device is used to move data around. You
> are looking for floppy disks, CDs, USB keys (about the size of a pack of
> gum).
> - Note where they get the disk from originally (whether it was from the
> machine, meaning it could have a program or data on it already, or out of
> a package of new disks).
> - Track the chain of custody: Where it is taken, and have someone watch it
> when taken to any other machine, note what programs you can see on the
> other machine
> - Note whether (and what time) it comes back and if it is put into the
> machine again.
> k. Moving the results: They have to move the results somehow. Ask
> questions about their procedures.
> - Is someone coming and going every hour or so with paper results?
> - Are they moving results to the Internet with a floppy or CD or USB key
> (looks like a little piece of plastic, about the size of a piece of gum)
> - If no one is leaving the machine to post the results, chances are they
> are doing this at the computer, meaning they are probably hooked up to a
> network or the Internet. Ask questions about the details and record what
> they say, and the name of the person who says it.
> l. If you see somebody open a web page or they do something that lets you
> know there has been Internet access, write it down.
> 
> m. BEHAVIORAL CUES:
> 
> - Note whether people look worried or stressed. Log the time it begins and
> the time it ends and who they are.
> - A now a word about .wranglers.. Some elections offices appoint a person
> -- sometimes a party observer they are chummy with -- to act as
> .wranglers.. They identify any person who might ask troublesome questions,
> and if an event occurs that could cause embarrassment, the appointed
> wrangler then goes over to distract the observers. Really. This is an
> elections procedure in some jurisdictions. They actually call it a
> wrangler.
> - If someone comes over and engages you in conversation, look around, and
> see if officials have suddenly congregated into an office or people are
> huddling over a computer. See if you can find out what you are not
> supposed to see.
> - Log behavior that is distracting, noting the time and person.
> - Log time and people involved in other distraction events, for example:
> The lights suddenly go out; a fire alarm goes off; someone spills
> something, loud noises, someone knocks something over.
> 
> RECORDS TO REQUEST:
> 
> Each state has a public records act, but in most cases, you can get
> records you ask for if you are nice. Here are important records you.ll
> want:
> 
> 1. Get a copy of each INTERIM RESULTS REPORT. Stand guard over what you
> have. If someone comes in to remove or .replace one with a better copy.
> hang onto the first and take the replacement, marking it. Make sure all
> interim reports are time-stamped by the computer. If they aren.t, note the
> exact time you see them appear.
> 
> 2. Request the COMPUTER AUDIT LOG for Oct. 29-Nov 2 (actually, it is
> important to get the printout BEFORE YOU LEAVE that night. It will only be
> a few pages, and can be printed from the vote-tally program.s menu.
> 
> 3. Ask for a copy of all the POLLING PLACE RESULTS SLIPS. These are sent
> in with the results cartridges. Try to get copies before you leave that
> night. If they won.t give copies to you then, put in a public records
> request and ask how soon you can pick them up.
> 
> 4. Ask for a copy of THE UPLOAD LOGS. These are on the computer and can be
> printed out on election night. They list each polling place and the time
> results were uploaded.
> 
> 5. There are ADDITIONAL LOGS in the Diebold GEMS programs you can request:
> From the GEMS folder .data., ask for the poster logs. There may be folders
> in the GEMS .data. directory titled .download., .log., .poster. and
> .results.. Ask for copies of these logs.
> 
> 6. Here.s a report that is very long but incredibly important and
> valuable. Ask if you can have the ELECTION NIGHT DETAIL REPORT -- the
> precinct by precinct results as of the time all memory cards are uploaded
> from all precincts. Depending on the system, they.ll call it different
> things -- in Diebold, it is called the Statement of Votes Cast (SOVC)
> report.
> 
> 7. Let us know which REPORTS THEY REFUSE to give you on Election Night. We
> can then put in Freedom of Information (public records) requests formally.
> 
> Once we have your observation log, and the records you obtain on Election
> Night, we can start matching up events and data to audit for anomalies.
> 
> # # # # #
> 
> Post information in the county and state at BlackBoxVoting.ORG. If the
> site is hacked out, come back as soon as it is up and post the
> information.
> 
> Thank you, and let.s have an orderly election.

> 
> Now, there is a film crew who has been brave enough to capture what's
> really going on:
> 
> THIS IS THE ONE: Here's the film that's breaking new ground on voting
> machine investigations. Includes never before seen footage and
> information:
> 
> download 30 minute preview of the upcoming feature film.
> 
> NOTE: Please give your attention to the real film by the real
> investigators: Russell Michaels, Simon Ardizzone, and Robert Carrillo
> Cohen -- they are the real deal. (Someone who ran off with a portion of
> the proprietary footage has been pitching a similarly named, inferior
> production which is missing most of the good stuff.) By the way, we've
> worked with most of the documentary producers out there, and Russell
> Michaels, Simon Ardizzone and Robert Carrillo Cohen are in a class by
> themselves -- In my opinion, they are the only filmmakers who have been
> doing real, in-depth, long-term in-the-field investigations on this issue
> -- Bev Harris.
> 
> Remember:
> 
> - Don't concede: Candidates, make a statement about voting without
> auditing. Hold off on your concession until the canvass is done
> - Gotta be replaced: If your county melts down into litigation, hold
> officials accountable if they chose to ignore warnings and failed to
> mitigate risks with preventive actions (like disconnecting telephone
> modems).
> 
> Note that most voting machine problems will be found between Nov. 3-12,
> during the canvass, and a few weeks later, when public records requests
> are obtained.
