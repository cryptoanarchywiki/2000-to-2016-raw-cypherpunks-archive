           In the light of the U.S. reliance on foreign oil in
                          this troubled world,
          domestic oil refineries are constantly strengthening
                            their reserves
          in accord with the energy policy of President Bush

          As one analyst said, "No more being held as a hostage
                               for oil."

            Global Oil Supply Uncertainty Raises Interest in
         American Oil Producers; Gulftex Oil Ready to Assist in
                             Meeting Demand

        HOUSTON, Nov. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Tensions in the oil
        rich Middle East have renewed interest in American oil
        reserves and domestic producers such as Gulftex Energy
        Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GTXE - news).

        In an ABC News report October 22, 2001, the network
        quoted Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Pfiefer as stating,
        ``It is quite feasible that we could see prices rise if
        conditions overseas escalate in some form,'' adding
        that Pfeifer and several other analysts are predicting
        higher oil prices similar to what the U.S. experienced
        during the 1970s when restrained production from OPEC
        and military and political volatility in the Middle
        East led to skyrocketing oil prices and fuel costs.

        Heightening fears of a diminished oil supply are U.S.
        Government suggestions that the ``War on Terrorism''
        could extend to other nations beyond Afghanistan, some
        of which may be OPEC nations or allies of OPEC
        countries. The effect of such action could ``abruptly
        change'' the output from OPEC according to the ABC
        report. OPEC meets again in Vienna on November 14,
        2001.

        Moreover, ABC states that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia
        produces more than double the oil production of the
        rest of the world combined and as a potential target of
        exiled Saudi Osama Bin Laden, a ``nightmare scenario''
        would be a successful attack on that oil supply or its
        distributing ports.

        Amid these fears, interest has risen in domestic oil
        suppliers such as Gulftex Energy Corporation, a Houston
        based integrated petroleum company involved in
        exploration and production, transportation, refining,
        and retail marketing. The company develops and manages
        oil and gas fields, focusing on the Permian Basin in
        New Mexico and Texas, onshore United States Gulf Coast,
        and the Gulf of Mexico, offshore in Indonesia, Nigeria
        and Qatar. The Company is also involved in pipeline
        transportation, oil & refined products trading, and
        shipping.

        The ABC report also states that an alternative to
        Middle Eastern oil dependence is to develop existing
        oil resources within the United States. The U.S. Energy
        Department is expected to unveil a report soon
        outlining the benefits of developing and expanding
        domestic oil reserves, including bumping up the
        strategic reserve, again, according to the report.

        Earlier this year amid threats of rolling blackouts,
        President Bush and U.S. Dept. of Energy's Spencer
        Abraham repeatedly called for increased domestic
        drilling.

        ``We're looking forward to an increase in incentives
        for domestic oil exploration and production,'' said
        Marc Duchesne, president of Gulftex Energy Corporation.
        ``We will be making some dramatic announcements in the
        very near future regarding the acquisition of large oil
        and gas properties in the United States. Stay tuned.''

        Gulftex Energy Corporation is an integrated petroleum
        company involved in exploration and production,
        transportation, refining, and retail marketing. The
        Company develops and manages oil and gas fields,
        focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky plus
        onshore United States Gulf Coast and the Gulf of
        Mexico, including offshore. The Company is also
        involved in pipeline transportation, oil & refined
        products trading & shipping.

<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Global Oil Supply Uncertainty
Raises Interest in American Oil Producers; Gulftex Oil Ready to Assist
in Meeting Demand</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>HOUSTON, Nov. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Tensions in the oil rich Middle East
have renewed interest in American oil reserves and domestic producers such
as Gulftex Energy Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GTXE - news).</b>
<p><b>In an ABC News report October 22, 2001, the network quoted Merrill
Lynch analyst Steven Pfiefer as stating, ``It is quite feasible that we
could see prices rise if conditions overseas escalate in some form,'' adding
that Pfeifer and several other analysts are predicting higher oil prices
similar to what the U.S. experienced during the 1970s when restrained production
from OPEC and military and political volatility in the Middle East led
to skyrocketing oil prices and fuel costs.</b>
<p><b>Heightening fears of a diminished oil supply are U.S. Government
suggestions that the ``War on Terrorism'' could extend to other nations
beyond Afghanistan, some of which may be OPEC nations or allies of OPEC
countries. The effect of such action could ``abruptly change'' the output
from OPEC according to the ABC report. OPEC meets again in Vienna on November
14, 2001.</b>
<p><b>Moreover, ABC states that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia produces more than
double the oil production of the rest of the world combined and as a potential
target of exiled Saudi Osama Bin Laden, a ``nightmare scenario'' would
be a successful attack on that oil supply or its distributing ports.</b>
<p><b>Amid these fears, interest has risen in domestic oil suppliers such
as Gulftex Energy Corporation, a Houston based integrated petroleum company
involved in exploration and production, transportation, refining, and retail
marketing. The company develops and manages oil and gas fields, focusing
on the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas, onshore United States Gulf
Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico, offshore in Indonesia, Nigeria and Qatar.
The Company is also involved in pipeline transportation, oil &amp; refined
products trading, and shipping.</b>
<p><b>The ABC report also states that an alternative to Middle Eastern
oil dependence is to develop existing oil resources within the United States.
The U.S. Energy Department is expected to unveil a report soon outlining
the benefits of developing and expanding domestic oil reserves, including
bumping up the strategic reserve, again, according to the report.</b>
<p><b>Earlier this year amid threats of rolling blackouts, President Bush
and U.S. Dept. of Energy's Spencer Abraham repeatedly called for increased
domestic drilling.</b>
<p><b>``We're looking forward to an increase in incentives for domestic
oil exploration and production,'' said Marc Duchesne, president of Gulftex
Energy Corporation. ``We will be making some dramatic announcements in
the very near future regarding the acquisition of large oil and gas properties
in the United States. Stay tuned.''</b>
<p><b>Gulftex Energy Corporation is an integrated petroleum company involved
in exploration and production, transportation, refining, and retail marketing.
The Company develops and manages oil and gas fields, focusing on New Mexico,
Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky plus onshore United States Gulf Coast and the
Gulf of Mexico, including offshore. The Company is also involved in pipeline
transportation, oil &amp; refined products trading &amp; shipping.</b>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE: Certain matters discussed within this press release
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Gulftex believes the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,
