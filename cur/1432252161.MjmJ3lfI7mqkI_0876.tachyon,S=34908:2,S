        Hankin Ozone products and markets water purification
        systems internationally in Mexico, the Caribbean, and
        Canada. Ozone is electronically charged oxygen. When

            Ozolutions Announces an Agreement in Principle to
         Provide Hankin Water Purification System to Homeowners

          Ontario Distributor Will Offer Purification System To
                       Homebuilders And Homebuyers

        TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 4, 2001-- Ozolutions
        Inc. (OTCBB:OZLU - news), an international distributor
        of water purification systems, announced today that it
        had entered into an agreement in principle with one of
        Canada's largest providers of home comfort systems to
        offer the the option of having the Hankin Ozone
        EntrOzone water purification system installed both in
        existing and new homes across Ontario.

        Based on initial test market results, Ozolutions will
        develop a marketing strategy and technical support
        program that will benefit all home builders that offer
        their new residential customers water purification as
        part of a home utilities package that is generally
        offered in home developments.

        There is increased public awareness about the quality
        of water and the Hankin EntrOzone system is a secure,
        safe, reliable, and affordable product that delivers
        purified water. Hankin has been in business over 65
        years and has an ozone-based treatment of water that
        far surpasses the normal chlorine and filter
        techniques. The EntrOzone is a unique combination of
        technologies including ozone (electrically charged
        water molecules), Ultra-Violet light, and activated
        carbon filters that provide maximum protection against
        bacteria, viruses, metal contaminants and harmful
        chemicals including pesticides that may infiltrate
        sources of drinking water.

        Ozolutions will also offer homebuilders and homeowners
        complete servicing and financing for EntrOzone buyers.
        The company estimates the sale of 2400 EntrOzone units
        through its preferred home services distribution
        channel and the additional sale of 600 units through
        company direct and dealer sales. EntrOzone has a
        suggested retail price of $4000 (USD) and, based on
        current sales estimates, Ozolutions initial projections
        indicate potential gross revenues of approximately
        $8,000,000 (USD) over the next 12 months. Max
        Weissengruber, President of Ozolutions said, "The
        opportunity for our company to deliver the Hankin
        technology to one of Canada's largest providers of home
        comfort appliances is exciting. Ozolutions and the home
        product supplier are exploring the strategic
        implementation of the agreement and we are confident
        that homebuilders and homeowners will be delighted with
        the product, service, and cost effectiveness of having
        a reliable supply of purified water.''

        The MarketPlace for Ozone treated water is rapidly
        growing. There are presently more than 250 ozone
        treatment plants under design or construction in the
        United States. As water treatment plants respond to US
        Environmental Protection Agency regulations, more than
        10,000 smaller drinking water treatment facilities will
        be looking to add ozone oxidation processes to their
        drinking water.

        Ozone treated water is also important to:

           * Tourism
           * Business Consumers
           * Waste Water Treatment
           * Fish Hatcheries
           * Municipalities
           * Urban & Rural Home builders

        The proximity of the Mexican market and the Caribbean
        market provides an extremely cost-effective platform
        for sales, shipment, and service. As part of their
        strategic marketing plan, Ozolutions is developing a
        dealer network of independent agents and contractors
        capable of selling, installing systems and servicing
        customers.

is the exclusive distributor for Hankin Ozone products and markets water
purification systems internationally in Mexico, the Caribbean Zone, and
Canada. Ozone is electronically charged oxygen. When ozone is injected
into a water stream and dissolves, it removes the impurities in water.
Ozone has a very short life-span and after it is injected into the water,
it returns to be oxygen within a few minutes. With the use of ozone, water
can be treated to a degree of purity unachievable by any other means. Ozone
purification is a proven method that is very cost efficient.&nbsp;</font>
