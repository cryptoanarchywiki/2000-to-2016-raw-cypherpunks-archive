Want to Trade Links?

Dear Member,

We're excited to announce our Partnership with 
Timothy L. Drobnick Sr. with ProfitBanners.com, 
TimsHomeTownStories.com, MyShoppingPlace.com, 
PutPEEL.com, PutPEEL.net, SELLinternetACCESS.com,
Be-Your-Own-ISP.com, and SeventhPower.com.

***  ***

    Because of your affiliation you are entitled to receive free 
our very popular "Your Membership Exchange" and 
"Your Membership Community & Commentary."
<p>
 
Both publications are about making money on the net, and 
each provides a convenient and FREE way to trade links with 
other members.
<p>
Try to read every issue, if no time atleast scan: you will get 
something valuable and profitable out of each issue!
<p>
"Your Membership Exchange" is sent Monday through 
Thursday, and is THE place to exchange ideas with other 
members, trade links, ask questions, discuss topics you 
are interested in, and even have your site spotlighted and 
reviewed by other members.
<p>
"Your Membership Community & Commentary" is sent 
only on Friday, and through this newsletter you'll hear from 
the best guest authors on the net and learn new marketing 
strategies, how to build your traffic and your business, and 
how to capitalize on the power and potential the web brings 
to every Net-preneur.  Also, you'll have the opportunity to share 
in the successes and failures of other members, with 
firsthand accounts from our members on how to succeed.  
You can have your website spotlighted in our 'Center Stage' 
feature, or share your website strategies, FREE.
<p>
Watch for your first issue of "Your Membership Community & Commentary" coming soon.

You may opt-out at anytime, but with access to nearly 
300,000 other web marketers and the opportunity to 
exchange ideas, learn from others, openly and freely 
trade links, and even have your site spotlighted, we 
believe you'll find "Your Membership" to be an 
indispensible free resource.

Sincerely,

Michael T. Glaspie
