NO MORE!! The continuing death of thousands of animals as a result of the 
live sheep and cattle trade, is an indictment on a barbaric practice that 
caters to religious traditions that evolved in another millennium. To 
subject animals to the suffering, that long cramped trips across the ocean 
causes, is not justifiable on any grounds, let alone religious grounds. To 
pander to these religious observances, is an indictment on both those who 
provide the animals for live export, and those who demand that the animals 
are not slaughtered in Australia. There is not one reason that can justify 
this cruel export industry. Animals can and are slaughtered in Australia 
under strict Halal conditions. Slaughterhouses are built that face Mecca 
and slaughter men can and do kill animals in the prescribed manner in 
Australia, to suit the religious demands of those people who follow the 
Muslim faith. To pander to those who demand live animals, is unjust, cruel, 
barbaric and cannot be justified, irrespective of the profits this trade 
generates. A halt should be placed on the trade today. The RSPCA should 
unilaterally remove its support for this disgusting trade. All those 
corporations who are making money as a result of this trade should be 
subjected to a consumer boycott today. Everybody involved in the trade, 
from the farmers, to the transport companies, to the shipping concerns, 
should be identified. Anybody who is involved in any aspect of this 
unnecessary trade, should be the focus of a community organised consumer 
boycott. The sooner shareholders and individual owners of these 
corporations, realise that their participation in this trade will erode 
their bottom line, the sooner this cruel business will be stopped. RIGHT 
ROYAL SKULLDUGGERY Last weekend marked the fifth anniversary in what can be 
described as the House of Windsor's luckiest break - the death in a car 
accident in Paris, of Diana Spencer, a woman who had long ago outlived her 
usefulness to the British Royal family. It's interesting to note that the 
House of Windsor has not held any Public event to mark the fifth 
anniversary of the death of the future monarch's mother. Basking in the 
glory of her Golden Jubilee celebrations, the last thing Queen Elizabeth 
II, the Queen of Australia would want, is a public rival for the affection 
of her loyal subjects. Diana Spencer's untimely death, and the public 
grieving which accompanied her death, shocked the House of Windsor to its 
foundations. The outpouring of public grief was in a large part an 
indication of the public's disquiet about how a 19 year old woman had been 
treated by the British Royal Family, after she had done her duty and 
delivered the heirs that the British Royal Family desperately needed, to 
keep the legion of members of the House of Windsor on the public payroll. 
If Diana Spencer had lived, she could have dimmed the star of Her Right 
Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth The Second. No wonder the retinue of media 
spin doctors that are paid by the public purse who work for the House of 
Windsor, have worked overtime, to smooth the feathers of a pliant media 
that has been blinded to the small-mindedness, bigotry and downright 
jealousy displayed by the British Royal Family by the Jubilee celebrations. 
The only good thing about the fifth anniversary of Diana Spencer's death is 
that people have not forgotten the myopic self-serving behaviour of the 
British Royal Family. A group, that to the last man and woman, has shown, 
and continues to show a callous disregard for their tawdry role, in the sad 
life of a woman who long before her sudden unexpected death, had outlived 
her usefulness to the British Monarchy. ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. 
What role would euthanasia play in an anarchist society? A. The right to a 
gentle and painless death ­ euthanasia is a right that¹s inherent within a 
society that recognises that the individual has the ultimate right over 
their own life and death. As far as terminal illnesses and illnesses that 
are accompanied by unremitting pain that cannot be treated, the decision is 
very simple. Euthanasia becomes a debating point within an anarchist 
society if community expectations about euthanasia push people in 
particular situations to consider ending their own lives. Individuals with 
terminal and chronic illnesses have first and foremost the right to demand 
support from society. Any discussion about euthanasia must originate from 
the person concerned, not from society. In a society where euthanasia is a 
right, it¹s possible that an expectation could arise that if an individual 
has a terminal or chronic illness they should consider euthanasia so they 
are not a burden on society. The development of community expectations 
about who should or shouldn¹t end their own life can and will pressure 
people into making decisions they may not want to make, so they are not a 
burden on the community. The other problem that faces a community where 
euthanasia is an inherent part of that community is do people who don¹t 
have a terminal or chronic illness have the right to euthanasia. The two 
age groups within a community that commit suicide are normally the young 
and the old. Suicide is often linked to a psychiatric disorder. Should 
people with a psychiatric disorder have the right to choose death over 
life? There seems to be a double standard among some anarchists about 
psychical and psychiatric illnesses. Some anarchists think psychiatric 
illnesses are illnesses that don¹t need to be treated. My experience is 
that once anarchists are confronted with friends or associates who develop 
psychiatric illnesses, they¹re keen to use what treatments are available to 
help resolve the problem. The problem of psychiatric illness raises 
important questions about who has and hasn¹t the right to demand euthanasia 
in an anarchist society. Most people who attempt to commit suicide with 
psychiatric illnesses and are treated and survive, lead long and productive 
lives. As up to one in five persons in any community considers suicide as a 
way out of a difficult emotional situation, should all these people have 
access to a peaceful and painful death? What at first seemed a very simple 
proposal, let the individual decide, is in reality a very difficult 
concept. Euthanasia, like every other human decision, is much more 
difficult than it at first seems. My own belief is that people who have 
chronic and debilitating illnesses or terminal illnesses who are not 
suffering depression or a psychiatric illness and those individuals who 
have psychiatric illnesses that do not respond to treatment who want to end 
their own lives, should have access to euthanasia. Euthanasia should be a 
choice that should be exercised only by those individuals who have the 
intellectual, emotional and psychological capacity to make that choice. 
Anything else would be community sanctioned murder. ACTION BOX "CELEBRATING 
OUR VICTORIES" How may times have you been involved in a successful 
struggle and been surprised at how your contribution to that struggle has 
been ignored or downplayed? I think more times than you care to remember. 
I¹ve been amazed at how many times the very people in authority who have 
lost a struggle attempt to claim credit for the outcome. We¹re told that 
"they never intended to carry out their proposal" or that what we are 
witnessing "is democracy in action." It¹s just as important we celebrate 
our victories than it is to learn from our losses. It¹s important we claim 
our victories publicly. Every time we claim and celebrate our victories, we 
destroy the idea that "you can¹t fight city hall". Every time we achieve 
our aims we give hope and courage to other people who are involved in 
local, regional, national and international struggles. Every time we allow 
the very institutions we fought against to claim victory, we are doing 
ourselves and everybody who is involved in struggles, a disservice. Don¹t 
be bashful about blowing your own trumpet, if you don¹t do it, nobody else 
will. As we all know, success breeds success. Victory in one struggle can 
give impetus to another struggle. Knowing that the institutions, 
bureaucracies and corporations that we are challenging can be confronted 
and defeated, has a positive effect on other people involved in disputes 
and campaigns against authority. It¹s important we try to build on the 
success we have had and continue to have. Recording how a particular 
victory was achieved can help other groups who are involved or who want to 
become involved in other struggles. The energy that¹s generated from 
celebrating a victory helps to recharge people¹s batteries for the next 
struggle. Always inform the media about your success. The more people who 
know that you took on "city hall" and won, the greater the reputation of 
the group you¹re involved in, will grow. More importantly, the destruction 
of the myth that the government or a major corporation is invincible, 
places government and corporations under increasing pressure from people 
and organisations that are struggling or want to become involved in the 
struggle for both reform and radical social change. AUSTRALIAN RADICAL 
HISTORY THE EUREKA SERIES NO. 31 "TURNING THE TABLES" The acquittal of the 
13 defendants charged with High Treason, turned the tables on Hotham and 
his scurvy crew. Although Hotham took the blame for the judicial farce, the 
Attorney-General William Stawell was ultimately responsible for this whole 
sorry saga. While men and women who were involved in the Eureka stockade 
are largely forgotten, a Victorian regional town ŒStawell¹ still bears the 
Attorney-General¹s name and Australia¹s most prestigious and well know 
professional footrace "The Stawell Gift", honours the memory of the man who 
engineered the butchery which occurred at Ballarat on December the 3rd 
1854. Stawell not only goaded the diggers into taking up arms and organised 
the military response, he was also responsible for attempting to pervert 
"the course of justice" by manipulating the jury system and by encouraging 
the virtual army of spies he had working for his department, to perjure 
themselves at the trials of the 13 accused. Hotham paid the ultimate price 
for his rigidity and his role in the Eureka rebellion. Lord John Russell 
from the London Colonial Office, scolded Hotham for not following his 
advice and charging the 13 with High Treason. The London Colonial Office 
did not believe a local jury would convict the men of the charge. Broken in 
health, Hotham had been forced by November 1855 to send his resignation to 
the Colonial Office. Hotham died on the 31st December 1855 as a result of a 
"chill", some say a "broken heart". The Legislative Council was asked by 
John Pascoe Fawkner, one of Melbourne¹s founders, to set aside a thousand 
pounds (a colossal sum in 1856) to build a monument to Sir Charles Hotham. 
Peter Lalor the Eureka stockade leader, had been elected to the Legislative 
Council, opposed the motion stating that "Hotham had a sufficient monument 
in the graves of those slain at Ballarat". The motion was passed and a 
thousand pounds was set aside to build a monument in Hotham¹s memory.

and Answers on the Spanish Anarchist Resistance. - Miguel GARCIA, Kate 
Sharpley Library 2002, 1ST Published by Simion circa 1970. ISBN 187360503X 
"Dar la vida par la vida (Give a life for life) Miguel Garcia Garcia 
(1908-1981) The Kate Sharpley Library collective has done the anarchist 
world a favour by publishing this 16 page "memorial booklet" which examines 
the life of Miguel GARCIA. One of the best kept secrets in both the 
anarchist and non anarchist world is the anarchist resistance to France¹s 
dictatorial rule after the failure of the Spanish revolution in 1939. "He 
was, as he himself ruefully admitted, the embodiment of a lost history of 
anarchism ­ part of a resistance movement, even now little know or 
understood by many". Miguel Garcia was a fighter in Barcelona during the 
July days of 1936, he fought on the Aragon Front and outside Madrid with 
the anarchist militias. After the failure of the Spanish revolution, Garcia 
who had been trained by the British as a forger, helped to smuggle refugees 
from France back to Spain. He was arrested in Spain by French soldiers in 
1949, Miguel was initially sentenced to death but his sentence was commuted 
to 30 years imprisonment, he was released in 1969 and immigrated to England 
at the invitation of Stuart Christie. Miguel Garcia spent the rest of his 
life working tirelessly to help imprisoned militants. Garcia was the 
International Secretary of the newly reformed Anarchist Black Cross, an 
anarchist prisoner aide organisation. Kate Sharpley¹s "memorial booklet" on 
Miguel Garcia includes an interview with Garcia first published by Simion 
Press in the early 1970¹s and a series of previously unpublished letters 
sent to London newspapers and journals. The interview gives an all too 
brief insight into how the resistance against the Franco regime was 
organised and the type of activities they were involved in before Franco¹s 
death. The interview "explains the motivation and methods of the 
resistance". Miguel Garcia¹s story opens the page on the libertarian 
resistance in Franco¹s Spain, an era that was dismissed by liberals, the 
international media and governments as work of "terrorists". "But to the 
world, the Resistance had become criminals, for Franco made the laws, even 
if, when dealing with political opponents he chose to break the laws 
established by the constitution; and the world still regards us as 
criminals" ­ Miguel GARCIA Other books available from the Kate Sharpley

technological innovations can change how we think, what we do and the very 
perception of what is considered to be normal behaviour. The single most 
important personal technological innovation that has had a profound impact 
in both the industrial world and the non industrialised world in the last 
decade has been the mobile phone. The minimal infrastructure that¹s 
required to set up a mobile network has allowed the East Timorese to 
overcome the devastation caused by the Indonesian Army and Indonesian 
backed militias much more quickly than was expected. Mobile phones have 
changed the way we communicate with each other, both at a personal and 
business level. It¹s also become a very important tool in that it helps 
activists conduct demonstrations, occupations and even revolutions. It 
allows participants to communicate with each other in real time and vary 
strategies used to meet real time needs. I¹m not denying that there are 
problems, privacy, auditory pollution and the risk of developing brain 
tumors are a few of the problems associated with mobile phone users. 
Interestingly the mobile phone¹s greatest contribution to life has little 
to do with communication and everything to do with perception. The mobile 
phone has changed the way we view human behaviour. If ten years ago you 
were walking down the street and began talking to yourself, you¹d have been 
given a wide berth. Today it¹s normal, on any day at anytime people are 
spilling their guts anywhere and everywhere. We¹ve regaled with the most 
intimate details of people¹s lives. Inadvertently we become unwilling 
spectators in a game that draws complete strangers in our orbit. I remember 
one day some time ago, some fool was blurbering into thin air with his 
estranged girlfriend, everybody around him broke into spontaneous applause 
when she told him to grow up and get a life. He became indigent when he 
realised that he had made his private life into a tedious and boring public 
spectacle. There¹s nothing worse than being forced to listen to other 
people¹s problems. Driving, it is common to see some idiot jabbering into 
the ether, laughing and carrying on all by themselves. Less than a decade 
ago such behaviour would have been rewarded with a visit by smiling folk 
dressed in white carrying straight jackets, today it¹s seen as normal. Ten 
years down the track, I will still find it a little disconcerting to see 
people talking to themselves on the streets, in cars and everywhere I go. 
STOP PRESS REALLY? Two years after I began writing in the Anarchist Age 
Weekly Review that the Federal government was intent on destroying bulk 
billing, the corporate and State run media have begun to respond to the 
threat. As more and more general practices begin to feel the current harsh 
commercial reality, many are beginning to abandon bulk billing. Medicare 
was introduced in 1972 by the Whitlam Labor government to ensure that every 
Australian, irrespective of income, had access to medical care outside of a 
public hospital setting. Bulk billing was welcomed by the more community 
minded elements of the medical profession as well as the general public, 
especially people with large families, those on social security benefits 
and working people on limited incomes. For the first time in the history of 
this country, they had access to affordable medical care. Over the past 
decade, the Howard government has gone out of its way to undermine the 
public hospital sector and destroy bulk billing. They have diverted three 
billion dollars that should have gone to the public hospital system to the 
private health insurance industry. They have also squeezed general 
practitioners by not keeping the medicare rebate in line with inflation. As 
cuts escalate, general practitioners have been forced to selectively bulk 
bill and in some cases abandon billing completely. Those who suffer are not 
those who can afford private health insurance or those who can pay the gap 
between the medicare rebate and the new fees charged by general 
practitioners. They are the poor, working people, the disadvantaged and 
people on social security benefits, the very people the medicare system was 
established to help. Increasing gaps between the medicare rebate and the 
cost of using general practitioners are driving people to use overcrowded 
public hospital Accident and Emergency departments as their port of call. 
The swamping of Accident and Emergency departments by non urgent cases has 
profound negative implications for a public hospital sector that is already 
struggling to cope. General practitioners and the people they service have 
been asked to bear the brunt of the government¹s attack on the medicare 
system and bulk billing. They will not be able to withstand this onslaught 
unless individuals, organisations and local health authorities and State 
governments put pressure on the Howard government to adequately fund 
medicare. Until Australians become involved in campaigns to defend and 
extend medicare and bulk billing, the horror stories about the health care 
system that have become an everyday news item will continue to occur with 
increasing frequency. Joseph TOSCANO/LibertarianWorkers for a Self-Managed 
Society.
