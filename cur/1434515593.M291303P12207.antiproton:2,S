So anyone want to take bets on if it's Gavin+Hearn that have a short
position on bitcoin, or if it's Adam Back? (Well, okay, who's *paying*
them that has a short position.. they probably have been conditioned
to believe they are doing the 'right' thing)

This to me looks like someone is engineering an engineering basis for
a bitcoin price crash, just as demand is going to pick up.
