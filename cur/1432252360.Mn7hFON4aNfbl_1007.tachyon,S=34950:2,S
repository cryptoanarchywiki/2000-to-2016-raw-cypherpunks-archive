<br>Subject:&nbsp; Information on credit card processing for your site
<p>>From: richard burgess - suwat54@yahoo.com
<br>>Subject: Connecting credit card payments to site? (Issue #426)
<br>>
<br>-- >I have been enjoying and learning via your information -
<br>thank you. Now I am almost ready to launch my internet
<br>business, but as I am quite naive to this, I can't
<br>seem to find a way to connect visa or other credit
<br>cards for payment for my service. &lt; --
<p>I would like to help out with information on getting credit card
<br>processing for a site.
<p>First, check with your host and make sure they allow business
<br>accounts on your server! Then if that is ok'd check the amount
<br>of traffic you are allowed and be sure the server will handle
<br>your customer traffic.
<p>For the service itself, there are several ways to go. You can
<br>set up a full merchant account (Just do a search for the words
<br>"merchant Account" in any search engine and you will find plenty
<br>of offerings.) Then do the research with each company to check
<br>for fees, per sale charges, how it will be integrated into your site
<br>(secure server or a link, etc.) and whether or not it will work with
<br>your shopping cart software if you have one. Check with other
<br>customers of the account provider and make sure they are happy
<br>with the processing time, how the charge backs were handled,
<br>the security of the server, etc.
<p>There are several drawbacks to this method the first being cost.
<br>Usually you have to pay a set up fee, a monthly fee, a per charge
<br>fee, a charge back fee, and possibly a fee for equipment. You also
<br>have to pass a credit check and wait for the account to be set up.
<p>The second method is to sign up with a processing company that
<br>processes your sale for you and then keeps a part (a percentage
<br>ranging from 5% to as high as 45% that I've seen) of each sale to
<br>process each order.
<p>The customer just clicks on the "buy now" link on your site
<br>and they are whisked away to the secure page the processing co.
<br>has set up for your item. Each item usually has it's own page so
<br>you don't usually have a shopping cart with this method.
<p>A good example of this kind of provider is ClickBank.com or
<br>iBill.com. ClickBank has a 49.00 set up fee (one time not per item)
<br>and a $1 +7% fee per transaction. iBill has no set up fee but
<br>charges 15% of each transaction.
<p>The disadvantage to this method is that it is difficult to set up
<br>a shopping cart system, so selling multiple items may be tough.
<br>You could set up groups of items as single items though, and
<br>work around it that way. The advantages are that you don't
<br>have to pass a credit check or get seperate merchant accounts
<br>for visa/mc, discover, and AX who all use different merchant set ups.
<p>Click Bank and iBill will also will run an affiliate program for
<br>you complete with tracking, paying the commissions and all of
<br>the details such as stats, fraud tracking, and paying the affiliates
<br>who only get $ for each sale- not click thru. This will increase
<br>your sales exponentially!
<p>The third method is a service like PayPal.com which is like iBill
<br>and ClickBank but doesn't have the ability to run an affiliate program.
<br>They have just started to offer a shopping cart feature and they
<br>have no sign up fees, no monthly fees and only charge $3.00 + 3%
<br>(the last time I checked) per transaction.
<p>I hope this helps-

<br>Kay Strong
<br>strongone@door.net
<br>~~~~
<p>I think the site is very attractive but have a little bit of a bone
<br>to pick with any MLM program that offers what they called
<br>a "Partner Program" since I feel those terms to be generally
<br>associated with affiliate programs and felt a bit misled when
<br>I went over there and realized it was MLM.&nbsp; However, as
<br>MLM sites go, this one is done well.
<p>It always helps me to see a picture of the business owners
<br>and Kay and hubby look very nice.
<br>~~~~
<p>I liked the design of this site. The font was easy to read and
<br>the information clear and easy to understand. For improvements
<br>I do have some easy suggestions:
<br>1- I did have to use the horizontal scroll bar with some of the pages
<br>2- On the 'takeamoment' page the last sentence should have had
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a question mark before the enter link.
<br>3- Sometimes the enter link or findoutmore link was blue, sometimes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black. Always have it the same.
<br>4- findout.html page, 3rd paragraph, 'ealth' should be 'wealth'
<br>5- findout.html page, last paragraph, last sentence, 'committ' should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be 'commit'
<br>6- No contact information for Kay &amp; Bob
<br>~~~~
<p>A typical biz op page. The product is health supplements.
<br>The page is nice and clear, and the photo of the two of the
<br>proprietors adds a personal touch. The information is all there,
<br>but the buttons on the side bar open in new windows while
<br>the links in the main frame open there. Not much to fault.
<br>Does its job pretty well.
<br>~~~~
<p>This website seemed to be too big for my screen - a lot of
<br>horizontal scrolling to read the text. Other than that I liked
<br>this site, but on the Usana site it was linked to there were
<br>missing graphics and some typos.
<br>~~~~
<p>I found the site fabulousincome to be targeted to people
<br>new at network marketing.&nbsp; The information was great for
<br>them, but for me I would have liked to see a page with just
<br>the facts, maybe a bullet point outline of the major benefits
<br>and how joining with them would be good for me. I didn't
<br>like having to go through page by page to get to a form to
<br>get a report. Nice layout though.

<br>processing for a site.
<p>First, check with your host and make sure they allow business
<br>accounts on your server! Then if that is ok'd check the amount
<br>of traffic you are allowed and be sure the server will handle
<br>your customer traffic.
<p>For the service itself, there are several ways to go. You can
<br>set up a full merchant account (Just do a search for the words
<br>"merchant Account" in any search engine and you will find plenty
<br>of offerings.) Then do the research with each company to check
<br>for fees, per sale charges, how it will be integrated into your site
<br>(secure server or a link, etc.) and whether or not it will work with
<br>your shopping cart software if you have one. Check with other
<br>customers of the account provider and make sure they are happy
<br>with the processing time, how the charge backs were handled,
<br>the security of the server, etc.
<p>There are several drawbacks to this method the first being cost.
<br>Usually you have to pay a set up fee, a monthly fee, a per charge
<br>fee, a charge back fee, and possibly a fee for equipment. You also
<br>have to pass a credit check and wait for the account to be set up.
<p>The second method is to sign up with a processing company that
<br>processes your sale for you and then keeps a part (a percentage
<br>ranging from 5% to as high as 45% that I've seen) of each sale to
<br>process each order.
<p>The customer just clicks on the "buy now" link on your site
<br>and they are whisked away to the secure page the processing co.
<br>has set up for your item. Each item usually has it's own page so
<br>you don't usually have a shopping cart with this method.
<p>A good example of this kind of provider is ClickBank.com or
<br>iBill.com. ClickBank has a 49.00 set up fee (one time not per item)
<br>and a $1 +7% fee per transaction. iBill has no set up fee but
<br>charges 15% of each transaction.
<p>The disadvantage to this method is that it is difficult to set up
<br>a shopping cart system, so selling multiple items may be tough.
<br>You could set up groups of items as single items though, and
<br>work around it that way. The advantages are that you don't
<br>have to pass a credit check or get seperate merchant accounts
<br>for visa/mc, discover, and AX who all use different merchant set ups.
<p>Click Bank and iBill will also will run an affiliate program for
<br>you complete with tracking, paying the commissions and all of
<br>the details such as stats, fraud tracking, and paying the affiliates
<br>who only get $ for each sale- not click thru. This will increase
<br>your sales exponentially!
<p>The third method is a service like PayPal.com which is like iBill
<br>and ClickBank but doesn't have the ability to run an affiliate program.
<br>They have just started to offer a shopping cart feature and they
<br>have no sign up fees, no monthly fees and only charge $3.00 + 3%
<br>(the last time I checked) per transaction.
<p>I hope this helps-

<p>I think the site is very attractive but have a little bit of a bone
<br>to pick with any MLM program that offers what they called
<br>a "Partner Program" since I feel those terms to be generally
<br>associated with affiliate programs and felt a bit misled when
<br>I went over there and realized it was MLM.&nbsp; However, as
<br>MLM sites go, this one is done well.
<p>It always helps me to see a picture of the business owners
<br>and Kay and hubby look very nice.
<br>~~~~
<p>I liked the design of this site. The font was easy to read and
<br>the information clear and easy to understand. For improvements
<br>I do have some easy suggestions:
<br>1- I did have to use the horizontal scroll bar with some of the pages
<br>2- On the 'takeamoment' page the last sentence should have had
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a question mark before the enter link.
<br>3- Sometimes the enter link or findoutmore link was blue, sometimes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black. Always have it the same.
<br>4- findout.html page, 3rd paragraph, 'ealth' should be 'wealth'
<br>5- findout.html page, last paragraph, last sentence, 'committ' should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be 'commit'
<br>6- No contact information for Kay &amp; Bob
<br>~~~~
<p>A typical biz op page. The product is health supplements.
<br>The page is nice and clear, and the photo of the two of the
<br>proprietors adds a personal touch. The information is all there,
<br>but the buttons on the side bar open in new windows while
<br>the links in the main frame open there. Not much to fault.
<br>Does its job pretty well.
<br>~~~~
<p>This website seemed to be too big for my screen - a lot of
<br>horizontal scrolling to read the text. Other than that I liked
<br>this site, but on the Usana site it was linked to there were
<br>missing graphics and some typos.
<br>~~~~
<p>I found the site fabulousincome to be targeted to people
<br>new at network marketing.&nbsp; The information was great for
<br>them, but for me I would have liked to see a page with just
<br>the facts, maybe a bullet point outline of the major benefits
<br>and how joining with them would be good for me. I didn't
<br>like having to go through page by page to get to a form to
<br>get a report. Nice layout though.
