Depends on the converter, whether it keeps the Adobe spying
features witting or unwitting -- which it may be aware of or not.
And whether it has a deal with Adobe to retain disguised.

Adode hidden code is quite devious -- for example it may remain
hidden to use the converted version as a host germ carrier to
propagate itself, following the bio model in our guts to use
feces as fertilizer.

Be careful about using free products, such as Adobe Reader
and free converters of formats of all kinds. They often contain
germs similar to the way NSA and other spies implant germs
in innocuous programs and platforms -- "free" is as devious as
"open" to those who exploit public trust in freedom and openness.
Journalism a prime exploiter under the brand of freedom of the
press to exploit with constitutional protection.

Gmail is one of the most notorious germ transmitters. Tor not quite
as evil, but less because newer than the Internet itself, the Internet
Archive, Wikipedia, social media, PGP, and many more which may
have had noble origins but have been adopted (and bought) by
converters of good to evil -- most readily by government contracts,
vulture capitalism, desparately broke and in debt, entrapment and
coercion by law enforement -- or all of them.

This list is beyond good and evil, thus spoke Zarathrusta, aka
TCM, JG, EH. Though those gods are dead.

Pardon my ignorance about this, and I will do my own research, but do 
these hidden formattings/stego/call-home functions disappear, get 
mutilated, become broken when 'converting' such PDF documents to 
other document types via use of many 'conversion' tools (Calibre 
comes to mind instantly) or are these embedded organisms a persistent 
across any automated conversion routine?

Cheers,
Benjamin
