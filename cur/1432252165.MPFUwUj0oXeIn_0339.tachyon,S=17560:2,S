Dear Friend:

YOU CAN make over a half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from
your home for a one time investment of only twenty five U.S.
Dollars.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
============================================

Be a millionaire like others within a year !!

Before you say "Bull", please read the following. This is the
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to
the popularity of this letter on the internet, a National weekly
news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation
of the program described below to see if it really can make
people money.

The show also investigated whether or not the porgram was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are
"absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program
and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound
to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM
HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one participant had to say:

"Thanks for this profitable opportunity". "I was approached many
times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad that I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I
received a total of $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks with money still
coming in". - Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Another participant stated: "This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it but one day when I received
this again I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the
simple instructions and walaa......3 weeks later the money
started to come in. The first month I only made $240.00 but the
next two months after that I made a total of $290,000,00. So far
in the past 8 months, by re-entering the progam I have made over
$710.000.00 and I am starting it again. The key to success in
this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything".

More testimonials later but first,

********PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE******

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like
to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!!

INSTRUCTIONS:

**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.

****For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person
whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE
YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case
of any mail problems.

****When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5
reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them
on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 =
$25.00

**** Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the
5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your
computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

****IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any
way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or
you will loose out on a majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not
work if you change it.

Remember - this method has been tested and if you alter it, it
WILL NOT WORK!!!. People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all
the money. It definately does not work that way. Believe us, we
all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So - DO
NOT try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty
reaps the rewards!!!!!

1....After yu have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2....Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 DOWN TO REPORT # 5.

3....Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down to REPORT # 4.

4....Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down to REPORT # 3.

5....Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down to REPORT # 2.

6....Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 position

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY !

=====================================================

Take this eitire letter with the modified list of names and save
it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this
on a disk as well just in case you loose any data.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mail legally, where
to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: by sending bulk E-MAIL LEGALLY

========================================Let's say that you decide
to start smail, just to see how it goes and we will assume you
and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also
assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% response (the
response still could probably be much better but let's say it is
only 0.2%. Also - many people will send out hundereds of
thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.
Those 10 people respond by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded
with orders. That's = 100 people who responded and ordered
Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000
orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. Those 10,000
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders
for Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 each = $500,000.00 (half a Million
dollars)

Your total income in this example is:

Report 1 - $50.00 +

Report 2 - $500 +

Report 3 - $5,000 +

Report 4 - $50,000 +

Report 5 - $500,000 +.......Grand Total = $555,550.00 +

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

-----------------------------------------------------

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERED OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 250 million people
on the internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people
will do just that AND MORE!!!

method # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

=====================================================
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads
on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go
along.

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report that they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they
send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they can not advertise until they receive that report.

__________________AVAILABLE REPORTS____________________

ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT'S NUMBER & NAME ONLY.

Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY ONLY) for each report.
Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping
it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are
ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and you name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDLINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT #2. If you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you and the cash
will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER : Every time your name is moved
down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS
AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this
business!!!
______________________________________________________

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGAM:

You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE
BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and
months than you have ever imagined.

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in
any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to
e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report #1 and move others to #2...-...#5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send
out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of
them. Remember though, the more you send out, the more potential
customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!!!!!

****************MORE TESTIMONIALS**********************

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am
an accountant with a jajor U.S. Corporation and I make pretty
good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody
about eceiving "Junk Mail". I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both feet.
I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old "I told
you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was
on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received a total of $147,200 all in cash! I
was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby". - Mitchell
Wolf, Chicago, Illinois.

-------------------------------------------------------

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am,
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back.

I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box
crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where
people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a
faster return and so big". - Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

------------------------------------------------------

"I had received this program before. I deleted it but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it
luckily came again.....I did not delete this one! I made more
than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22
weeks". Susan De Suza, New York, NY

------------------------------------------------------

"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My
first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of the third month
my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, thanx
to internet". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand.
