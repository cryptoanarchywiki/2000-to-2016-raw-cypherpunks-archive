QUESTIONS:

From:  bollow   - bollow@earthlink.net
Subject:  Can I work on a website from 2 computers w/ the same server?

Hi, 

I have two computers, an old Windows 3.1  and new 
Windows 98. (Both use Earthlink.) I built my website on 
W3.1 with Navigator Gold (without HTML)-- what you see is 
what you get and like working from there. 

However in bringing up website on W98-- spacing is dif.  I 
would like to put the Navigator Gold onto W98 and work on 
the Website from there-- could download more pix etc. and 
other machine is getting creaky. (Still not sure about 
accessing the FTP from W98.)  

Any problems you foresee-- or is it possible to work on the 
website from TWO computers with same server?

Thanks for any helpful information.

Peggy,
 
There are two things you can do to protect your images. 
I would utilize both.
 
The first way is to disable the right-click function with 
JavaScript. Put the following code into the HEAD of your 
HTML document. You can customize the alert message 
to say whatever you want.
 
NOTE:  To have this show up correctly in the Exchange, 
the [ and ] were used instead of < and >
Replace all '[' signs with the '<' and all ']' with the '>' sign.

[script language="javascript"]

function click() {
if (event.button==2) {
alert('You are not authorized to right click this page! All images and source code are copyright 2001
}
}
document.onmousedown=click
[/script]

The other way is to create a 1x1 pixel transparent gif and
use it over the top of your graphic by making your graphic
the background of a TABLE. Like this.

[TABLE BACKGROUND="your_graphic.jpg"
BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"]

[TR][TD][IMG SRC="1by1transparent.gif"  WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="370"]
[/TD][/TR][/TABLE]

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #137:  http://www.traces.nu

~~~~

This is an excellent site.  It loaded quickly, had photos of 
the items for sale and these photos also loaded quickly.  
The site is dedicated to selling antiquities at what seems 
to be very reasonable prices.

There is plenty of rare stock to choose from, rather better 
than a shop, because you can access and see items in far 
faster than you could in a shop.   I like the link bar which 
stays at the top of the screen no matter how far down the 
page you go, the first time I have seen something like this!
~~~~

An interesting and well arranged site. 
~~~~

This site is very well done and interesting.  Very fast loading!  
I wish the menu bar at the top would stop jumping around 
though.  Very annoying.  Either make it stable or put a sidebar 
menu that doesn't move.  

Theonly other thing that I would suggest is that the site owner
put more information about themselves aimed at establishing
credibility.  There was a short statement stating that they 
guaranteed anything sold on the site to be authentic but a 
guarantee is only as good as the word of the person who gave 
it. All I know is that they are in the Netherlands.  How do we 
know this is legitimate business?  How long have you been in 
business? etc. etc.  Tell us more about who and what you are 
and how you obtain the things you have for sale.
~~~~

Excellent site - everything worked, it was well laid out, 
colour co-ordinated and interesting!  Liked the unusual 
floating top menu.
~~~~

Very pleasant site to view, and easy to navigate with the 
floating menu. Everything was very well presented.

But, I would be a bit nervous about ordering. I would have 
liked to see some background information about you, how 
long you have been in business, what your qualifications 
are, and why I should do business with you, or testimonials 
from previous customers.
~~~~

Site 137 traces.nu was a wonderful site!  Very elegant and 
simple to use. I love the way the navigation bar goes down 
the page with you! Makes getting around much simpler. 
I wouldn't change a thing!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THANKS!

From:  stuart.reid   - stuart.reid@ntlworld.com
Subject:  Thanks for suggestions!

Just a quick note to thank everyone who wrote with 
suggestions for my site http://www.essjayar.co.uk/

I'll try varying the background with a view to removing 
or moving the blue-wave and try to get people to return 
to the pages I want them too.
 
Thanks for your input!

<p>This is an excellent site.&nbsp; It loaded quickly, had photos of
<br>the items for sale and these photos also loaded quickly.
<br>The site is dedicated to selling antiquities at what seems
<br>to be very reasonable prices.
<p>There is plenty of rare stock to choose from, rather better
<br>than a shop, because you can access and see items in far
<br>faster than you could in a shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the link bar which
<br>stays at the top of the screen no matter how far down the
<br>page you go, the first time I have seen something like this!
<br>~~~~
<p>An interesting and well arranged site.
<br>~~~~
<p>This site is very well done and interesting.&nbsp; Very fast loading!
<br>I wish the menu bar at the top would stop jumping around
<br>though.&nbsp; Very annoying.&nbsp; Either make it stable or put a sidebar
<br>menu that doesn't move.
<p>Theonly other thing that I would suggest is that the site owner
<br>put more information about themselves aimed at establishing
<br>credibility.&nbsp; There was a short statement stating that they
<br>guaranteed anything sold on the site to be authentic but a
<br>guarantee is only as good as the word of the person who gave
<br>it. All I know is that they are in the Netherlands.&nbsp; How do we
<br>know this is legitimate business?&nbsp; How long have you been in
<br>business? etc. etc.&nbsp; Tell us more about who and what you are
<br>and how you obtain the things you have for sale.
<br>~~~~
<p>Excellent site - everything worked, it was well laid out,
<br>colour co-ordinated and interesting!&nbsp; Liked the unusual
<br>floating top menu.
<br>~~~~
<p>Very pleasant site to view, and easy to navigate with the
<br>floating menu. Everything was very well presented.
<p>But, I would be a bit nervous about ordering. I would have
<br>liked to see some background information about you, how
<br>long you have been in business, what your qualifications
<br>are, and why I should do business with you, or testimonials
<br>from previous customers.
<br>~~~~
<p>Site 137 traces.nu was a wonderful site!&nbsp; Very elegant and
<br>simple to use. I love the way the navigation bar goes down
<br>the page with you! Makes getting around much simpler.
<br>I wouldn't change a thing!

<p><b>THANKS!</b>
<p>From:&nbsp; stuart.reid&nbsp;&nbsp; - stuart.reid@ntlworld.com
<br>Subject:&nbsp; Thanks for suggestions!
<p>Just a quick note to thank everyone who wrote with
<br>suggestions for my site <a href="http://www.essjayar.co.uk/">http://www.essjayar.co.uk/</a><a href="http://www.essjayar.co.uk/"></a>
<p>I'll try varying the background with a view to removing
<br>or moving the blue-wave and try to get people to return
<br>to the pages I want them too.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Thanks for your input!
