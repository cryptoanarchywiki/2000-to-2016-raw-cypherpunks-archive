The reason for this is the work that /all/ of these institutes do. It is 
bigger then what an individual or, is some cases, a small group can 
accomplish. And can easily be undermined if details are published. Who 
is it to say that what CIA has been doing is not in U.S. best interest. 
You? Me?

How many people know that the institute been used as a road to power? 5? 
10? 10.000? We know that in hindsight Bush Senior during his days as the 
captain was very much so into promoting his own agenda. He did things 
that if you and me would do 'm we'd be locked up, gassed or otherwise 
effectively terminated. An agenda, that in is own head, is in the best 
interest of the U.S.

How does the institute itself look upon itself? We don't know. But most 
likely they are EXACTLY what I'd expect from the U.S. public in general:
If it were that easy to breed even a thing as consensus among the 
American public, to whom admitting to be false or admitting that they do 
not hold all the key information is far more likely to be interpreted as 
a personal attack then parsed on a rational level as self-criticism... 
the enablers of many mad politicians would have a hard(er) time.

I can tell you that any low-level contractor or employee /with /brains 
looks upon the three-letter institutes and sees exactly that. And they 
are even allowed to. Ed walked around the office in a EFF sweater. And 
the CIA very well knows that they can not change that mentality.

So accountability does JACK SHIT. Transparency does not change the 
equation, because, people cling to power. And even now a lot of things 
are out there, in the open, we, as a nation are still O.K. with electing 
Jeb Bush into office (I think he'll win).

However, bending, massaging the general public in a slow, but very 
effective way does yield it's rewards. As we know, Ed's work 
steered/stirred public debate on some level.

It is a cultural issue. It is not like people are going to suffer from 
cognitive dissonance if they do not allow themselves to peep outside of 
the box.

That sounds quite nihilistic. People will do what ever they can come up 
with. Unless someone tells them: "No, you can not do this. And if you 
do, I'm here to stop you." However, as long as people cling to power, 
the enablers so to speak, are there will be hard times ahead for people 
that are on the shitty end of the shtick.

True. Especially if it is concerned a people's government. But that 
would re-frame reality in which secrets serve a purpose. Most battles 
are preceded by a conspiracy of some kind. A conspiracy usually requires 
a great deal of security. And I'd like to venture into saying that 
people in power will not give up the power they legitimately have. Ever. 
Most of the public debate has been polarized to the point that people 
planting themselves on the middle ground of any argument are eaten by 
both sides anyway. There is a reason why people are closed gays, 
atheists, black, smurfs, anarchists, etcetera. If everyone would be as 
understanding as you and I we would not have to have this discussion in 
the first place.

But we don't live in that world. People do hurt each other per-emptively 
because of a difference in culture, color, flag etc.
