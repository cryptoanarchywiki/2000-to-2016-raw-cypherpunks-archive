<p>Hi!!
<p>I have been enjoying and learning via your information -
<br>thank you. Now I am almost ready to launch my internet
<br>business, but as I am quite naive to this, I can't
<br>seem to find a way to connect visa or other credit
<br>cards for payment for my service.
<p>Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

<p>SITE REVIEWED
<p>Comments on Site&nbsp; #126: <a href="http://www.EClassifiedshq.com">http://www.EClassifiedshq.com</a>
<br>Carol Cohen
<br>Opp0rtunity@aol.com
<br>~~~~
<p>The site is wonderfully set up and well organized. There is
<br>a graphic on most of all the pages at the bottom that will
<br>not load.
<br>~~~~
<p>This is the kind of site that should be using extensive meta tags
<br>for search engines to find it, and I didn't see any tags on some of
<br>the pages.&nbsp; The site is neatly laid out, but doesn't seem to be
getting
<br>the traffic it should have, with empty categories in a couple of areas.
<p>I would recommend adding meta tags, and looking for information on
<br>ranking high with search engines and incorporate it into all the pages.
<br>Also, think about what makes this site unique and what benefits it
<br>has over other classified sites - and then be sure to let your visitors
<br>know what they are! Add an introduction. Add a links page and
<br>exchange links with other classified sites. Maybe do something like
<br>"Add your ad and we'll send you a copy of 'How to Make Headlines
<br>Work' absolutely free" or some kind of report to help people write
a
<br>better ad.
<br>~~~~
<p>Looks and feels very professional. The pages are very well structured
<br>and are fast loading. In browsing them, I have found not many pictures,
<br>where there are pictures, they do not give a very good look. It must
be
<br>possible to have a bigger picture of e.g. a home for sale.
<p>I think this will give a better chance at success: attracting not only
<br>people who place their ad, but also pleasing the people who enjoy
<br>browsing the ads. They usually want immediately want to access
<br>important information (which for me in most cases includes a clear
<br>picture).
<p>There are also some graphics missing on the main page.
<p>As for the content: I hope more categories will get filled quick. It
<br>might be a good idea to have the fee structure available before one
<br>has to subscribe. I have not been able to find this information
<br>without subscribing.
<p>Finally, I find the site very well structured and easy to navigate.
<br>~~~~
<p>The present site as its name suggests is a classifieds site. And it
<br>is a free site that is open to anyone who is interesting in posting
<br>his advertisement. There are altogether 12 categories that one can
<br>host his ad and they range from announcements to automobiles
<br>and from personals to professional services. If you have seen a
<br>regular classified site there is hardly anything that will continue
to
<br>interest you in this site. It is a run-of-the-mill site that doesn't
have
<br>anything to set it apart.&nbsp;
<br>~~~~
<p>This site is colorful without being overpowering with the small
<br>graphics and colorful logo. It was very easy to navigate and find
<br>the general area for what I was looking for, but didn't find a lot
of
<br>ads yet and a lot of empty categories.&nbsp; The site looks great but
it
<br>looks like you need to work on getting traffic to your site now.

<p>The site is wonderfully set up and well organized. There is
<br>a graphic on most of all the pages at the bottom that will
<br>not load.
<br>~~~~
<p>This is the kind of site that should be using extensive meta tags
<br>for search engines to find it, and I didn't see any tags on some of
<br>the pages.&nbsp; The site is neatly laid out, but doesn't seem to be
getting
<br>the traffic it should have, with empty categories in a couple of areas.
<p>I would recommend adding meta tags, and looking for information on
<br>ranking high with search engines and incorporate it into all the pages.
<br>Also, think about what makes this site unique and what benefits it
<br>has over other classified sites - and then be sure to let your visitors
<br>know what they are! Add an introduction. Add a links page and
<br>exchange links with other classified sites. Maybe do something like
<br>"Add your ad and we'll send you a copy of 'How to Make Headlines
<br>Work' absolutely free" or some kind of report to help people write
a
<br>better ad.
<br>~~~~
<p>Looks and feels very professional. The pages are very well structured
<br>and are fast loading. In browsing them, I have found not many pictures,
<br>where there are pictures, they do not give a very good look. It must
be
<br>possible to have a bigger picture of e.g. a home for sale.
<p>I think this will give a better chance at success: attracting not only
<br>people who place their ad, but also pleasing the people who enjoy
<br>browsing the ads. They usually want immediately want to access
<br>important information (which for me in most cases includes a clear
<br>picture).
<p>There are also some graphics missing on the main page.
<p>As for the content: I hope more categories will get filled quick. It
<br>might be a good idea to have the fee structure available before one
<br>has to subscribe. I have not been able to find this information
<br>without subscribing.
<p>Finally, I find the site very well structured and easy to navigate.
<br>~~~~
<p>The present site as its name suggests is a classifieds site. And it
<br>is a free site that is open to anyone who is interesting in posting
<br>his advertisement. There are altogether 12 categories that one can
<br>host his ad and they range from announcements to automobiles
<br>and from personals to professional services. If you have seen a
<br>regular classified site there is hardly anything that will continue
to
<br>interest you in this site. It is a run-of-the-mill site that doesn't
have
<br>anything to set it apart.&nbsp;
<br>~~~~
<p>This site is colorful without being overpowering with the small
<br>graphics and colorful logo. It was very easy to navigate and find
<br>the general area for what I was looking for, but didn't find a lot
of
<br>ads yet and a lot of empty categories.&nbsp; The site looks great but
it
<br>looks like you need to work on getting traffic to your site now.
