Subject:  Software for pop-ups and anti-virus

Do you hate receiving Pop Ups while on-line?  Get this Pop Up Killer 
from http://software.xfx.net/ . Pop Up Killer shoots them dead.  It's 
FREE and I love it.

A friend told me about a new FREE Virus killer called Anti Vir.  
I downloaded it today from http://www.free-av.com/eula.htm 
Good Lord, it found 3 different viruses on my computer that 
McAfee, Inoculate, PC-illin and http://housecall.antivirus.com 
could not find.  Anti Vir searched through 111,000 files on my 
two hard drives.  The best of the other 4 only searched through 
80,000 files.  How could they miss the other 31,000 files?

Good Health and Happiness to you All.

QUESTIONS:

From:  MDegaston@aol.com
Subject:  Are forms possible in a cookie cutter website?

I have a website made with cookie cutters. I would like to add 
a place where people see little windows where they have to fill 
in their name, email address and possibly phone and a comment 
box. How does one create that or is it not possible on a cookie 
cutter website?  Is there a programming text (gif?) I can put in 
as is done with banners?

I am really a rank amateur and know very little so unless it is 
very very simple to do, I probably can't do it, mind you.

Appreciate your help.

Ng Lye Fong,

I know you've had a couple of long replies to this query re simple 
html form, but if you have a look at site 
http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/VICK2163 
you'll see a VERY easy way of getting the info you want, and it 
is a simple cut & paste html code. Let me know if you want it and 
I'll get the code to you. You can email me from the site, using the 
facility I'm talking about.

There might also be something of interest for you at: 
http://www.formsite.com . Just a thought.  Many thanks.

Cheers,

Lana

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #134:  http://www.LenSeiderInc.com
Len Seider
Lenseider@cs.com
~~~~

Hello Len - I reviewed your site. First I clicked to skip the flash 
intro. I was glad you had that option on your page as I hate 
waiting for those to download.
Your site is easy to navigate, and all the pages relate with the 
blue background, planets at the top, and the use of frames. The 
light blue text on the dark blue background can be tricky to read 
though.

Also, even with your philosophy written out, I could not grasp 
what the purpose of your site was. I never was quite sure what 
you were trying to accomplish.  By adding explanations on the 
'Our Team' and 'Site Index' page, maybe an introduction on the 
'Home' page, I and I would think your other visitors would be 
better able to tell how you can help them.

It sounds like you know what you are talking about, but I would 
take a guess your audience doesn't.
~~~~

First impression: Duuhhh.  The flash part never went into operation 
although I went to get some water, messed with the dogs, still no 
action. Something needs fixn'.

I bypassed that portion then and  the next page looks very pleasing, 
but that is if you like to just relax. If you want to get your visitors 
attention, there has to be more to catch the interest.. Unfortunately 
today's visitor does not take the time to squint at pale text on a dark 
background no matter how relaxing it might feel.  The page gives a 
certain IMAGE of refinement and that is possibly what you like to 
convey, but will it sell anything unless your cliental is already sold?
Just my thoughts on the matter.
~~~~

This was a fast loading site with minimal graphics (apart from the 
Our Team page which I was disappointed to find were just animations 
and not photos of the team!) and I liked the option to view without 
the Flash.  The Inclick graphic is missing on all the pages and just 
needs to be uploaded.
 
Although I read through the info quite carefully, I'm still puzzled as 
to what this website sells!  The home page tells us that the website 
purpose is to communicate but I'm sorry it failed to communicate to 
me just what services were provided.
~~~~

I assume Len Seider is an individual, so was disappointed there 
wasn't information about him, his background, a picture, or why 
I should trust him.

I don't care for the use of frames, and I don't think they were 
necessary for this site as there were only 4 pages, but the layout 
was organized well and carried through the whole site.
~~~~

First off, the blue on blue words are very hard on the eyes.  The 
home page sounds more like philosophy than a discription of what 
your services are.  What exactly do you do?  Do you focus on 
increasing a company's market share? Are you strictly a marketing 
company?  Are you a consulting firm?  All of the above? 

The "our team" page took forever to load (56k).  Does every pic 
need to be animated?  What is your purpose for this page?  Do you 
offer every service in the animations, or do you improve on existing 
services a company has in place?

Why do you have a site index page for a 4 page (one of them being 
the index page itself) web site?  It's just a couple of links anyway...
not an index of pages in your site.   Visiting this site left me so 
confused that the only way to find out about your services is to use 
the contact us page.  Maybe this is some clever trick that pulls tons 
of calls, but it just made me close the browser window.

<br>~~~~
<p>Hello Len - I reviewed your site. First I clicked to skip the flash
<br>intro. I was glad you had that option on your page as I hate
<br>waiting for those to download.
<br>Your site is easy to navigate, and all the pages relate with the
<br>blue background, planets at the top, and the use of frames. The
<br>light blue text on the dark blue background can be tricky to read
<br>though.
<p>Also, even with your philosophy written out, I could not grasp
<br>what the purpose of your site was. I never was quite sure what
<br>you were trying to accomplish.&nbsp; By adding explanations on the
<br>'Our Team' and 'Site Index' page, maybe an introduction on the
<br>'Home' page, I and I would think your other visitors would be
<br>better able to tell how you can help them.
<p>It sounds like you know what you are talking about, but I would
<br>take a guess your audience doesn't.
<br>~~~~
<p>First impression: Duuhhh.&nbsp; The flash part never went into operation
<br>although I went to get some water, messed with the dogs, still no
<br>action. Something needs fixn'.
<p>I bypassed that portion then and&nbsp; the next page looks very pleasing,
<br>but that is if you like to just relax. If you want to get your visitors
<br>attention, there has to be more to catch the interest.. Unfortunately
<br>today's visitor does not take the time to squint at pale text on a
dark
<br>background no matter how relaxing it might feel.&nbsp; The page gives
a
<br>certain IMAGE of refinement and that is possibly what you like to
<br>convey, but will it sell anything unless your cliental is already sold?
<br>Just my thoughts on the matter.
<br>~~~~
<p>This was a fast loading site with minimal graphics (apart from the
<br>Our Team page which I was disappointed to find were just animations
<br>and not photos of the team!) and I liked the option to view without
<br>the Flash.&nbsp; The Inclick graphic is missing on all the pages and
just
<br>needs to be uploaded.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Although I read through the info quite carefully, I'm still puzzled
as
<br>to what this website sells!&nbsp; The home page tells us that the website
<br>purpose is to communicate but I'm sorry it failed to communicate to
<br>me just what services were provided.
<br>~~~~
<p>I assume Len Seider is an individual, so was disappointed there
<br>wasn't information about him, his background, a picture, or why
<br>I should trust him.
<p>I don't care for the use of frames, and I don't think they were
<br>necessary for this site as there were only 4 pages, but the layout
<br>was organized well and carried through the whole site.
<br>~~~~
<p>First off, the blue on blue words are very hard on the eyes.&nbsp; The
<br>home page sounds more like philosophy than a discription of what
<br>your services are.&nbsp; What exactly do you do?&nbsp; Do you focus
on
<br>increasing a company's market share? Are you strictly a marketing
<br>company?&nbsp; Are you a consulting firm?&nbsp; All of the above?
<p>The "our team" page took forever to load (56k).&nbsp; Does every pic
<br>need to be animated?&nbsp; What is your purpose for this page?&nbsp;
Do you
<br>offer every service in the animations, or do you improve on existing
<br>services a company has in place?
<p>Why do you have a site index page for a 4 page (one of them being
<br>the index page itself) web site?&nbsp; It's just a couple of links
anyway...
<br>not an index of pages in your site.&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting this site
left me so
<br>confused that the only way to find out about your services is to use
<br>the contact us page.&nbsp; Maybe this is some clever trick that pulls
tons
<br>of calls, but it just made me close the browser window.
