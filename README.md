# 2000-to-2016-raw-cypherpunks-archive

See this post: https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2018-July/042515.html

This repo contains the extracted archive of the 2000 to 2016 cypherpunks mailing list archive. How complete it is, I do not know, but it looks pretty complete.

The raw tar.bz2 file provided by juan is available on the "Release" page.

The SHA-256 checksum of this file is 2d2c8fb79ae60f9a33ba2f78efad7a6106b931c59345a1e03b2c8eca0c87645c

**Note:** *If you scan this archive, some malware is detected. This is likely old infected emails which were sent to the list during its wholly-unfiltered period. I suspect you'd have to try to open them in an old version of outlook to actually be infected, but take care anyhow. These are all text files, not executables, so opening even the infected emails should be safe in most (if not all) text editors. But note that I take no responsibility for any harm or loss caused by the use of this archive.*
